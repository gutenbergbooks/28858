    <h2>
      PREFACE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The first printed version of the famous Tales of Margaret of Navarre,
      issued in Paris in the year 1558, under the title of &ldquo;Histoires des Amans
      Fortunez,&rdquo; was extremely faulty and imperfect. It comprised but
      sixty-seven of the seventy-two tales written by the royal author, and the
      editor, Pierre Boaistuau, not merely changed the order of those narratives
      which he did print, but suppressed numerous passages in them, besides
      modifying much of Margaret&rsquo;s phraseology. A somewhat similar course was
      adopted by Claude Gruget, who, a year later, produced what claimed to be a
      complete version of the stories, to which he gave the general title of the
      <i>Heptameron</i>, a name they have ever since retained. Although he
      reinstated the majority of the tales in their proper sequence, he still
      suppressed several of them, and inserted others in their place, and also
      modified the Queen&rsquo;s language after the fashion set by Boaistuau. Despite
      its imperfections, however, Gruget&rsquo;s version was frequently reprinted down
      to the beginning of the eighteenth century, when it served as the basis of
      the numerous editions of the <i>Heptameron</i> in <i>beau langage</i>, as
      the French phrased it, which then began to make their appearance. It
      served, moreover, in the one or the other form, for the English and other
      translations of the work, and down to our own times was accepted as the
      standard version of the Queen of Navarre&rsquo;s celebrated tales. Although it
      was known that various contemporary MSS. were preserved at the French
      National Library in Paris, no attempt was made to compare Gruget&rsquo;s faulty
      version with the originals until the Société des Bibliophiles Français
      entrusted this delicate task to M. Le Roux de Lincy, whose labours led to
      some most valuable discoveries, enabling him to produce a really authentic
      version of Margaret&rsquo;s admired masterpiece, with the suppressed tales
      restored, the omitted passages reinstated, and the Queen&rsquo;s real language
      given for the first time in all its simple gracefulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is from the authentic text furnished by M. Le Roux de Lincy that the
      present translation has been made, without the slightest suppression or
      abridgment. The work moreover contains all the more valuable notes to be
      found in the best French editions of the <i>Heptameron</i>, as well as
      numerous others from original sources, and includes a <i>résumé</i> of the
      various suggestions made by MM. Félix Frank, Le Roux de Lincy, Paul
      Lacroix, and A. de Montaiglon, towards the identification of the narrators
      of the stories, and the principal actors in them, with well-known
      personages of the time. An Essay on the <i>Heptameron</i> from the pen of
      Mr. George Saintsbury, M.A., and a Life of Queen Margaret, are also given,
      as well as the quaint Prefaces of the earlier French versions; and a
      complete bibliographical summary of the various editions which have issued
      from the press.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be supposed that numerous illustrated editions have been published
      of a work so celebrated as the <i>Heptameron</i>, which, besides
      furnishing scholars with a favourite subject for research and speculation,
      has, owing to its perennial freshness, delighted so many generations of
      readers. Such, however, is not the case. Only two fully illustrated
      editions claim the attention of connoisseurs. The first of these was
      published at Amsterdam in 1698, with designs by the Dutch artist, Roman de
      Hooge, whose talent has been much overrated. To-day this edition is only
      valuable on account of its comparative rarity. Very different was the
      famous edition illustrated by Freudenberg, a Swiss artist&mdash;the friend
      of Boucher and of Greuze&mdash;which was published in parts at Berne in
      1778-81, and which among amateurs has long commanded an almost prohibitive
      price.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Full-page Illustrations to the present translation are printed from
      the actual copperplates engraved for the Berne edition by Lon-geuil,
      Halbou, and other eminent French artists of the eighteenth century, after
      the designs of S. Freudenberg. There are also the one hundred and fifty
      elaborate head and tail pieces executed for the Berne edition by Dunker,
      well known to connoisseurs as one of the principal engravers of the <i>Cabinet</i>
      of the Duke de Choiseul.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Portrait of Queen Margaret placed as frontispiece to the present
      volume is from a crayon drawing by Clouet, preserved at the Bibliothèque
      Nationale, Paris.

    <p>
      In dealing with the life and work of Margaret of Angouleme (1) it is
      necessary at the outset to refer to the mother whose influence and
      companionship served so greatly to mould her daughter&rsquo;s career.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1 This Life of Margaret is based upon the memoir by M, Le
     Roux de Lincy prefixed to the edition of the <i>Heptameron</i>
     issued by the Société des Bibliophiles Français, but various
     errors have been rectified, and advantage has been taken of
     the researches of later biographers.
</pre>
    <p>
      Louise of Savoy, daughter of Count Philip of Bresse, subsequently Duke of
      Savoy, was born at Le Pont d&rsquo;Ain in 1477, and upon the death of her
      mother, Margaret de Bourbon, she married Charles d&rsquo;Orléans, Count of
      Angoulême, to whom she brought the slender dowry of thirty-five thousand
      livres. (1) She was then but twelve years old, her husband being some
      twenty years her senior. He had been banished from the French Court for
      his participation in the insurrection of Brittany, and was living in
      straitened circumstances. Still, on either side the alliance was an
      honourable one. Louise belonged to a sovereign house, while the Count of
      Angoulême was a prince of the blood royal of France by virtue of his
      descent from King Charles V., his grandfather having been that monarch&rsquo;s
      second son, the notorious Duke Louis of Orleans, (2) who was murdered in
      Paris in 1417 at the instigation of John the Bold of Burgundy.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  The value of the Paris livre at this date was twenty
     sols, so that the amount would be equivalent to about L1400.

     2  This was the prince described by Brantôme as a &ldquo;great
     débaucher of the ladies of the Court, and invariably of the
     greatest among them.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Vies des Dames galantes</i> (Disc. i.).
</pre>
    <p>
      Louise, who, although barely nubile, impatiently longed to become a
      mother, gave birth to her first child after four years of wedded life. &ldquo;My
      daughter Margaret,&rdquo; she writes in the journal recording the principal
      events of her career, &ldquo;was born in the year 1492, the eleventh day of
      April, at two o&rsquo;clock in the morning; that is to say, the tenth day,
      fourteen hours and ten minutes, counting after the manner of the
      astronomers.&rdquo; This auspicious event took place at the Château of
      Angoulême, then a formidable and stately pile, of which nowadays there
      only remains a couple of towers, built in the fourteenth and fifteenth
      centuries. Soon afterwards Cognac became the Count of Angoulême&rsquo;s
      favourite place of residence, and it was there that Louise gave birth, on
      September 12th, 1494, to her second child, a son, who was christened
      Francis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Louise&rsquo;s desires were now satisfied, but her happiness did not long remain
      complete. On January 1st, 1496, when she was but eighteen years old, she
      lost her amiable and accomplished husband, and forthwith retiring to her
      Château of Romorantin, she resolved to devote herself entirely to the
      education of her children. The Duke of Orleans, who, on the death of
      Charles VIII. in 1498, succeeded to the throne as Louis XII., was
      appointed their guardian, and in 1499 he invited them and their mother to
      the royal Château of Amboise, where they remained for several years.
    </p>
    <p>
      The education of Francis, who had become heir-presumptive to the throne,
      was conducted at Amboise by the Marshal de Gié, one of the King&rsquo;s
      favourites, whilst Margaret was intrusted to the care of a venerable lady,
      whom her panegyrist does not mention by name, but in whom he states all
      virtues were assembled. (1) This lady took care to regulate not only the
      acts but also the language of the young princess, who was provided with a
      tutor in the person of Robert Hurault, Baron of Auzay, great archdeacon
      and abbot of St. Martin of Autun. (2) This divine instructed her in Latin
      and French literature, and also taught her Spanish and Italian, in which
      languages Brantôme asserts that she became proficient. &ldquo;But albeit she
      knew how to speak good Spanish and good Italian,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;she always
      made use of her mother tongue for matters of moment; though when it was
      necessary to join in jesting and gallant conversation she showed that she
      was acquainted with more than her daily bread.&rdquo; (3)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  Sainte-Marthe&rsquo;s <i>Oraison funèbre de la Royne de Navarre</i>,
     p. 22. Margaret&rsquo;s modern biographers state that this lady was
     Madame de Chastillon, but it is doubtful which Madame
     de Chastillon it was. The Rev. James Anderson assumes it was
     Louise de Montmorency, the mother of the Colignys, whilst
     Miss Freer asserts it was Anne de Chabannes de Damniartin,
     wife of James de Chastillon, killed in Italy in 1572. M.
     Franck has shown, in his edition of the <i>Heptameron</i>, that
     Anne de Chabannes died about 1505, and that James de
     Chastillon then married Blanche de Tournon. Possibly his
     first wife may have been Margaret&rsquo;s governess, but what is
     quite certain is that the second wife became her lady of
     honour, and that it is she who is alluded to in the
     <i>Heptameron</i>.

      Such was Margaret&rsquo;s craving for knowledge that she even wished to obtain
      instruction in Hebrew, and Paul Paradis, surnamed Le Canosse, a professor
      at the Royal College, gave her some lessons in it. Moreover, a rather
      obscure passage in the funeral oration which Sainte-Marthe devoted to her
      after her death, seemingly implies that she acquired from some of the most
      eminent men then flourishing the precepts of the philosophy of the
      ancients.
    </p>
    <p>
      The journal kept by Louise of Savoy does not impart much information as to
      the style of life which she and her children led in their new abode, the
      palatial Château of Amboise, originally built by the Counts of Anjou, and
      fortified by Charles VII. with the most formidable towers in France. (1)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  The Château of Amboise, now the private property of the
     Count de Paris, is said to occupy the site of a Roman
     fortress destroyed by the Normans and rebuilt by Foulques
     the Red of Anjou. When Francis I. ascended the French throne
     he presented the barony of Amboise with its hundred and
     forty-six fiefs to his mother, Louise of Savoy.
</pre>
    <p>
      Numerous authorities state, however, that Margaret spent most of her time
      in study with her preceptors and in the devotional exercises which then
      had so large a place in the training of princesses. Still she was by no
      means indifferent to the pastimes in which her brother and his companions
      engaged. Gaston de Foix, the nephew of the King, William Gouffier, who
      became Admiral de Bonnivet, Philip Brion, Sieur de Chabot, Fleurange, &ldquo;the
      young adventurer,&rdquo; Charles de Bourbon, Count of Montpensier, and Anne de
      Montmorency&mdash;two future Constables of France&mdash;surrounded the
      heir to the throne, with whom they practised tennis, archery, and
      jousting, or played at soldiers pending the time when they were to wage
      war in earnest. (1)
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret was a frequent spectator of these pastimes, and took a keen
      interest in her brother&rsquo;s efforts whenever he was assailing or defending
      some miniature fortress or tilting at the ring. It would appear also that
      she was wont to play at chess with him; for we have it on high authority
      that it is she and her brother who are represented, thus engaged, in a
      curious miniature preserved at the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris. (2) In
      this design&mdash;executed by an unknown artist&mdash;only the back of
      Francis is to be seen, but a full view of Margaret is supplied; the
      personage standing behind her being Artus Gouffier, her own and her
      brother&rsquo;s governor.

     le Livre des Échecs amoureux et Archiloge Sophie</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      Whatever time Margaret may have devoted to diversion, she was certainly a
      very studious child, for at fifteen years of age she already had the
      reputation of being highly accomplished. Shortly after her sixteenth
      birthday a great change took place in her life. On August 3rd, 1508,
      Louise of Savoy records in her journal that Francis &ldquo;this day quitted
      Amboise to become a courtier, and left me all alone.&rdquo; Margaret accompanied
      her brother upon his entry into the world, the young couple repairing to
      Blois, where Louis XII. had fixed his residence. There had previously been
      some unsuccessful negotiations in view of marrying Margaret to Prince
      Henry of England (Henry VIII.), and at this period another husband was
      suggested in the person of Charles of Austria, Count of Flanders, and
      subsequently Emperor Charles V. Louis XII., however, had other views as
      regards the daughter of the Count of Angoulême, for he knew that if he
      himself died without male issue the throne would pass to Margaret&rsquo;s
      brother. Hence he decided to marry her to a prince of the royal house,
      Charles, Duke of Alençon.
    </p>
    <p>
      This prince, born at Alençon on September 2nd, 1489, had been brought up
      at the Château of Mauves, in Le Perche, by his mother, the pious and
      charitable Margaret of Lorraine, who on losing her husband had resolved,
      like Louise of Savoy, to devote herself to the education of her children.

    <p>
      It had originally been intended that her son Charles should marry Susan,
      daughter of the Duke and Duchess of Bourbon&mdash;the celebrated Peter and
      Anne de Beaujeu&mdash;but this match fell through owing to the death of
      Peter and the opposition of Anne, who preferred the young Count of
      Montpensier (afterwards Constable de Bourbon) as a son-in-law. A yet
      higher alliance then presented itself for Charles: it was proposed that he
      should marry Anne of Brittany, the widow of King Charles VIII., but she
      was many years his senior, and, moreover, to prevent the separation of
      Brittany from France, it had been stipulated that she should marry either
      her first husband&rsquo;s successor (Louis XII.) or the heir-presumptive to the
      throne. Either course seemed impracticable, as the heir, Francis of
      Angoulême, was but a child, while the new King was already married to
      Jane, a daughter of Louis XI. Brittany seemed lost to France, when Louis
      XII., by promising the duchy of Valentinois to Cæsar Borgia, prevailed
      upon Pope Alexander VI. to divorce him from his wife. He then married Anne
      of Brittany, while Charles of Alençon proceeded to perfect his knightly
      education, pending other matrimonial arrangements.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1507, when in his eighteenth year, he accompanied the army which the
      King led against the Genoese, and conducted himself bravely; displaying
      such courage, indeed, at the battle of Agnadel, gained over the Venetians&mdash;who
      were assailed after the submission of Genoa&mdash;that Louis XII. bestowed
      upon him the Order of St. Michael. It was during this Italian expedition
      that his mother negotiated his marriage with Margaret of Angoulême. The
      alliance was openly countenanced by Louis XII., and the young Duke of
      Valois&mdash;as Francis of Angoulême was now called&mdash;readily acceded
      to it. Margaret brought with her a dowry of sixty thousand livres, payable
      in four instalments, and Charles, who was on the point of attaining his
      twenty-first year, was declared a major and placed in possession of his
      estates. (1) The marriage was solemnised at Blois in October 1509.
    </p>

    <p>
      Margaret did not find in her husband a mind comparable to her own.
      Differences of taste and temper brought about a certain amount of
      coolness, which did not, however, hinder the Duchess from fulfilling the
      duties of a faithful, submissive wife. In fact, although but little
      sympathy would appear to have existed between the Duke and Duchess of
      Alençon, their domestic differences have at least been singularly
      exaggerated.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the first five years of her married life Margaret lived in somewhat
      retired style in her duchy of Alençon, while her husband took part in
      various expeditions, and was invested with important functions. In 1513 he
      fought in Picardy against the English and Imperialists, commanded by Henry
      VIII., being present at the famous &ldquo;Battle of Spurs;&rdquo; and early in 1514 he
      was appointed Lieutenant-General and Governor of Brittany. Margaret at
      this period was not only often separated from her husband, but she also
      saw little of her mother, who had retired to her duchy of Angoulême.
      Louise of Savoy, as mother of the heir-presumptive, was the object of the
      homage of all adroit and politic courtiers, but she had to behave with
      circumspection on account of the jealousy of the Queen, Anne of Brittany,
      whose daughters, Claude and Renée, were debarred by the Salic Law from
      inheriting the crown. Louis XII. wished to marry Claude to Francis of
      Angoulême, but Anne refusing her consent, it was only after her death, in
      1514, that the marriage was solemnised.
    </p>
    <p>
      It now seemed certain that Francis would in due course ascend the throne;
      but Louis XII. abruptly contracted a third alliance, marrying Mary of
      England, the sister of Henry VIII. Louise of Savoy soon deemed it prudent
      to keep a watch on the conduct of this gay young Queen, and took up her
      residence at the Court in November 1514. Shortly afterwards Louis XII.
      died of exhaustion, as many had foreseen, and the hopes of the Duchess of
      Angoulême were realised. She knew the full extent of her empire over her
      son, now Francis I., and felt both able and ready to exercise a like
      authority over the affairs of his kingdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The accession of Francis gave a more important position to Margaret and
      her husband. The latter was already one of the leading personages of the
      state, and new favours increased his power. He did not address the King as
      &ldquo;Your Majesty,&rdquo; says Odolant Desnos, but styled him &ldquo;Monseigneur&rdquo; or &ldquo;My
      Lord,&rdquo; and all the acts which he issued respecting his duchy of Alençon
      began with the preamble, &ldquo;Charles, by the grace of God.&rdquo; Francis had
      scarcely become King than he turned his eyes upon Italy, and appointing
      his mother as Regent, he set out with a large army, a portion of which was
      commanded by the Duke of Alençon. At the battle of Marignano the troops of
      the latter formed the rearguard, and, on perceiving that the Swiss were
      preparing to surround the bulk of the French army, Charles marched against
      them, overthrew them, and by his skilful manouvres decided the issue of
      the second day&rsquo;s fight. (1) The conquest of the duchy of Milan was the
      result of this victory, and peace supervening, the Duke of Alençon
      returned to France.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">

     ii. p. 238.
</pre>
    <p>
      It was at this period that Margaret began to keep a Court, which,
      according to Odolant Desnos, rivalled that of her brother. We know that in
      1517 she and her husband entertained the King with a series of magnificent
      fêtes at their Château of Alençon, which then combined both a palace and a
      fortress. But little of the château now remains, as, after the damage done
      to it during the religious wars between 1561 and 1572, it was partially
      demolished by Henry IV. when he and Biron captured it in 1590. Still the
      lofty keep built by Henry I. of England subsisted intact till in 1715 it
      was damaged by fire, and finally in 1787 razed to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old pile was yet in all its splendour in 1517, when Francis I. was
      entertained there with jousts and tournaments. At these gay gatherings
      Margaret appeared apparelled in keeping with her brother&rsquo;s love of
      display; for, like all princesses, she clothed herself on important
      occasions in sumptuous garments. But in every-day life she was very
      simple, despising the vulgar plan of impressing the crowd by magnificence
      and splendour. In a portrait executed about this period, her dark-coloured
      dress is surmounted by a wimple with a double collar and her head covered
      with a cap in the Bearnese style. This portrait (1) tends, like those of a
      later date, to the belief that Margaret&rsquo;s beauty, so celebrated by the
      poets of her time, consisted mainly in the nobility of her bearing and the
      sweetness and liveliness spread over her features. Her eyes, nose, and
      mouth were very large, but although she had been violently attacked with
      small-pox while still young, she had been spared the traces which this
      cruel illness so often left in those days, and she even preserved the
      freshness of her complexion until late in life. (2)

     where it will be found in the <i>Recueil de Portraits au
     crayon par Clouett Dumonstier, &amp;c</i>, fol. xi.

     2  Referring to this subject, she says in one of her letters:
     &ldquo;You can tell it to the Count and Countess of Vertus, whom
     you will go and visit on my behalf; and say to the Countess
     that I am sorely vexed that she has this loathsome illness.
     However, I had it as severely as ever was known. And if it
     be that she has caught it as I have been told, I should like
     to be near her to preserve her complexion, and do for her
     what Ï did for myself.&rdquo;&mdash;Génin&rsquo;s <i>lettres de Marguerite
     d&rsquo;Angoulême</i>, Paris, 1841, p. 374.

    <p>
      Like her brother, whom she greatly resembled, she was very tall. Her gait
      was solemn, but the dignified air of her person was tempered by extreme
      affability and a lively humour, which never left her. (1)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1 Sainte-Marthe says on this subject: &ldquo;For in her face, in
     her gestures, in her walk, in her words, in all that she did
     and said, a royal gravity made itself so manifest and
     apparent, that one saw I know not what of majesty which
     compelled every one to revere and dread her. In seeing her
     kindly receive every one, refuse no one, and patiently
     listen to all, you would have promised yourself easy and
     facile access to her; but if she cast eyes upon you, there
     was in her face I know not what of gravity, which made you
     so astounded that you no longer had power, I do not say to
     walk a step, but even to stir a foot to approach her.&rdquo;&mdash;
     <i>Oraison-funèbre, &amp;c</i>, p. 53.
</pre>
    <p>
      Francis I. did not allow the magnificent reception accorded to him at
      Alençon to pass unrewarded. He presented his sister with the duchy of
      Berry, where she henceforward exercised temporal control, though she does
      not appear to have ever resided there for any length of time. In 1521,
      when her husband started to the relief of Chevalier Bayard, attacked in
      Mézières by the Imperial troops, she repaired to Meaux with her mother so
      as to be near to the Duke. Whilst sojourning there she improved her
      acquaintance with the Bishop, William Briçonnet, who had gathered around
      him Gerard Roussel, Michael d&rsquo;Arande, Lefèvre d&rsquo;Etaples, and other
      celebrated disciples of the Reformation. The effect of Luther&rsquo;s preaching
      had scarcely reached France before Margaret had begun to manifest great
      interest in the movement, and had engaged in a long correspondence with
      Briçonnet, which is still extant. Historians are at variance as to whether
      Margaret ever really contemplated a change of religion, or whether the
      protection she extended to the Reformers was simply dictated by a natural
      feeling of compassion and a horror of persecution. It has been contended
      that she really meditated a change of faith, and even attempted to convert
      her mother and brother; and this view is borne out by some passages in the
      letters which she wrote to Bishop Briçonnet after spending the winter of
      1521 at Meaux.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst she was sojourning there, her husband, having contributed to the
      relief of Mézières, joined the King, who was then encamped at Fervacques
      on the Somme, and preparing to invade Hainault. It was at this juncture
      that Clement Marot, the poet, who, after being attached to the person of
      Anne of Brittany, had become a hanger-on at the Court of Francis I.,
      applied to Margaret to take him into her service. (1)

      Lenglet-Dufresnoy, in his edition of Marot&rsquo;s works, originated the theory
      that the numerous poems composed by Marot in honour of Margaret supply
      proofs of an amorous intrigue between the pair. Other authorities have
      endorsed this view; but M. Le Roux de Lincy asserts that in the pieces
      referred to, and others in which Marot incidentally speaks of Margaret, he
      can find no trace either of the fancy ascribed to her for the poet or of
      the passion which the latter may have felt for her. Like all those who
      surrounded the Duchess of Alençon, Marot, he remarks, exalted her beauty,
      art, and talent to the clouds; but whenever it is to her that his verses
      are directly addressed, he does not depart from the respect he owes to
      her. To give some likelihood to his conjectures, Lenglet-Dufresnoy had to
      suppose that Marot addressed Margaret in certain verses which were not
      intended for her. In the epistles previously mentioned, and in several
      short pieces, rondeaux, epigrams, new years&rsquo; addresses, and epitaphs
      really written to or for the sister of Francis I., one only finds
      respectful praise, such as the humble courtier may fittingly offer to his
      patroness. There is nothing whatever, adds M. Le Roux de Lincy, to promote
      the suspicion that a passion, either unfortunate or favoured, inspired a
      single one of these compositions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The campaign in which Francis I. was engaged at the time when Marot&rsquo;s
      connection with Margaret began, and concerning which the poet supplied her
      with information, was destined to influence the whole reign, since it
      furnished the occasion of the first open quarrel between Francis I. and
      the companion of his childhood, Charles de Bourbon, Count of Montpensier,
      and Constable of France. Yielding too readily on this occasion to the
      persuasions of his mother, Francis intrusted to Margaret&rsquo;s husband the
      command of the vanguard, a post which the Constable considered his own by
      virtue of his office. He felt mortally offended at the preference given to
      the Duke of Alençon, and from that day forward he and Francis were enemies
      for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst the King was secretly jealous of Bourbon, who was one of the
      handsomest, richest, and bravest men in the kingdom, Louise of Savoy,
      although forty-four years of age, was in love with him. The Constable,
      then thirty-two, had lost his wife, Susan de Bourbon, from whom he had
      inherited vast possessions. To these Louise of Savoy, finding her passion
      disregarded, laid claim, as being a nearer relative of the deceased. A
      marriage, as Chancellor Duprat suggested, would have served to reconcile
      the parties, but the Constable having rejected the proposed alliance&mdash;with
      disdain, so it is said&mdash;the suit was brought before the Parliament
      and decided in favour of Louise. Such satisfaction as she may have felt
      was not, however, of long duration, for Charles de Bourbon left France,
      entered the service of Charles V., and in the following year (1524) helped
      to drive the French under Bonnivet out of Italy.

</pre>
    <p>
      The most memorable events of Margaret&rsquo;s public life date from this period.
      Francis, who was determined to reconquer the Milanese, at once made
      preparations for a new campaign. Louise of Savoy was again appointed
      Regent of the kingdom, and as Francis&rsquo;s wife, Claude, was dying of
      consumption, the royal children were confided to the care of Margaret,
      whose husband accompanied the army. Louise of Savoy at first repaired to
      Lyons with her children, in order to be nearer to Italy, but she and
      Margaret soon returned to Blois, where the Queen was dying. Before the
      royal army had reached Milan Claude expired, and soon afterwards Louise
      was incapacitated by a violent attack of gout, while the children of
      Francis also fell ill. The little ones, of whom Margaret had charge,
      consisted of three boys and three girls, the former being Francis, the
      Dauphin, who died in 1536, Charles, Duke of Orleans, who died in 1545, and
      Henry, Count of Angoulême, who succeeded his father on the throne. The
      girls comprised Madeleine, afterwards the wife of James V. of Scotland,
      Margaret, subsequently Duchess of Savoy, and the Princess Charlotte. The
      latter was particularly beloved by her aunt Margaret, who subsequently
      dedicated to her memory her poem <i>Le Miroir de l&rsquo;Ame Pécheresse</i>.
      While the other children recovered from their illness, little Charlotte,
      as Margaret records in her letters to Bishop Briçonnet, was seized &ldquo;with
      so grievous a malady of fever and flux,&rdquo; that after a month&rsquo;s suffering
      she expired, to the deep grief of her aunt, who throughout her illness had
      scarcely left her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      This affliction was but the beginning of Margaret&rsquo;s troubles. Soon
      afterwards the Constable de Bourbon, in conjunction with Pescara and
      Lannoy, avenged his grievances under the walls of Pavia. On this occasion,
      as at Marignano, the Duke of Alençon commanded the French reserves, and
      had charge of the fortified camp from which Francis, listening to
      Bonnivet, sallied forth, despite the advice of his best officers. The King
      bore himself bravely, but he was badly wounded and forced to surrender,
      after La Palisse, Lescun, Bonnivet, La Trémoïlle, and Bussy d&rsquo;Amboise had
      been slain before his eyes. Charles of Alençon was then unable to resist
      the advice given him to retreat, and thus save the few Frenchmen who had
      escaped the arms of the Imperialists. With four hundred lances he
      abandoned the camp, crossed the Ticino, and reaching France by way of
      Piedmont, proceeded to Lyons, where he found Louise of Savoy and Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been alleged that they received him with harsh reproaches, and
      that, unable to bear the shame he felt for his conduct, he died only a few
      days after the battle. (1)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  See Garnier&rsquo;s <i>Histoire de France</i>, vol. xxiv.; Gaillard&rsquo;s
     <i>Histoire de France, &amp;c</i>. Odolant Desnos, usually well
     informed, falls into the same error, and asserts that when
     the Duke, upon his arrival, asked Margaret to kiss him, she
     replied, &ldquo;Fly, coward! you have feared death. You might find
     it in my arms, as I do not answer for myself.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Mémoires
     historiques</i>, vol. ii. p. 253.
</pre>
    <p>
      There are several errors in these assertions, which a contemporary
      document enables us to rectify. The battle of Pavia was fought on February
      14th, 1525, and Charles of Alençon did not die till April 11th, more than
      a month after his arrival at Lyons. He was carried off in five days by
      pleurisy, and some hours before his death was still able to rise and
      partake of the communion. Margaret bestowed the most tender care upon him,
      and the Regent herself came to visit him, the Duke finding strength enough
      to say to her, &ldquo;Madam, I beg of you to let the King know that since the
      day he was made a prisoner I have been expecting nothing but death, since
      I was not sufficiently favoured by Heaven to share his lot or to be slain
      in serving him who is my king, father, brother, and good master.&rdquo; After
      kissing the Regent&rsquo;s hand he added, &ldquo;I commend to you her who has been my
      wife for fifteen years, and who has been as good as she is virtuous
      towards me.&rdquo; Then, as Louise of Savoy wished to take Margaret away,
      Charles turned towards the latter and said to her, &ldquo;Do not leave me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Duchess refused to follow her mother, and embracing her dying husband,
      showed him the crucifix placed before his eyes. The Duke, having summoned
      one of his gentlemen, M. de Chan-deniers, instructed him to bid farewell
      on his part to all his servants, and to thank them for their services,
      telling them that he had no longer strength to see them. He asked God
      aloud to forgive his sins, received the extreme unction from the Bishop of
      Lisieux, and raising his eyes to heaven, said &ldquo;Jesus,&rdquo; and expired. (1)
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst tending her dying husband, Margaret was also deeply concerned as to
      the fate of her captive brother, for whom she always evinced the warmest
      affection. Indeed, so close were the ties uniting Louise of Savoy and her
      two children that they were habitually called the &ldquo;Trinity,&rdquo; as Clement
      Marot and Margaret have recorded in their poems. (2)

      In this Trinity Francis occupied the highest place; his mother called him
      &ldquo;her Cæsar and triumphant hero,&rdquo; while his sister absolutely reverenced
      him, and was ever ready to do his bidding. Thus the intelligence that he
      was wounded and a prisoner threw them into consternation, and they were
      yet undecided how to act when they received that famous epistle in which
      Francis wrote&mdash;not the legendary words, &ldquo;All is lost save honour,&rdquo;
       but&mdash;&ldquo;Of all things there have remained to me but honour and life,
      which is safe.&rdquo; After begging his mother and sister to face the extremity
      by employing their customary prudence, the King commended his children to
      their care, and expressed the hope that God would not abandon him. (1)
      This missive revived the courage of the Regent and Margaret, for shortly
      afterwards we find the latter writing to Francis: &ldquo;Your letter has had
      such effect upon the health of Madame [Louise], and of all those who love
      you, that it has been to us as a Holy Ghost after the agony of the
      Passion.... Madame has felt so great a renewal of strength, that whilst
      day and evening last not a moment is lost over your business, so that you
      need have no grief or care about your kingdom and children.&rdquo; (2)

      Louise of Savoy was indeed now displaying courage and ability. News
      shortly arrived that the King had been transferred to Madrid, and that
      Charles demanded most onerous conditions for the release of his prisoner.
      At this juncture Francis wrote to his mother that he was very ill, and
      begged of her to come to him. Louise, however, felt that she ought not to
      accede to this request, for it would be jeopardising the monarchy to place
      the Regent as well as the King of France in the Emperor&rsquo;s hands;
      accordingly she resolved that Margaret should go instead of herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Baron of St. Blancard, general of the King&rsquo;s galleys, who had
      previously offered to rescue Francis while the latter was on his way to
      Spain, received orders to make the necessary preparations for Margaret&rsquo;s
      voyage, of which she defrayed the expense, as is shown by a letter she
      wrote to John Brinon, Chancellor of Alençon. In this missive she states
      that the Baron of St. Blancard has made numerous disbursements on account
      of her journey which are to be refunded to him, &ldquo;so that he may know that
      I am not ungrateful for the good service he has done me, for he hath
      acquitted himself thereof in such a way that I have occasion to be
      gratified.&rdquo; (1)

      Despite adverse winds, Margaret embarked on August 27th, 1525, at
      Aigues-Mortes, with the President de Selves, the Archbishop of Embrun, the
      Bishop of Tarbes, and a fairly numerous suite of ladies. The Emperor had
      granted her a safe-conduct for six months, and upon landing in Spain she
      hurried to Madrid, where she found her brother very sick both in mind and
      body. She eagerly caressed and tended him, and with a good result, as she
      knew his nature and constitution much better than the doctors. To raise
      his depressed spirits she had recourse to religious ceremonies, giving
      orders for an altar to be erected in the room where he was lying. She then
      requested the Archbishop of Embrun to celebrate mass, and received the
      communion in company of all the French retainers about the prisoner. It is
      stated that the King, who for some hours had given no sign of life, opened
      his eyes at the moment of the consecration of the elements, and asked for
      the communion, saying, &ldquo;God will cure me, soul and body.&rdquo; From this time
      forward he began to recover his health, though he remained fretful on
      account of his captivity.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a difficult task to obtain his release. The Court and the Emperor
      were extremely polite, but Margaret soon recognised the emptiness of their
      protestations of good-will. &ldquo;They all tell me that they love the King,&rdquo;
       she wrote, &ldquo;but I have little proof of it. If I had to do with honest
      folks, who understand what honour is, I should not care, but it is the
      contrary.&rdquo; (1)

    <p>
      She was not the woman to turn back at the first obstacle, however; she
      began by endeavouring to gain over several high personages, and on
      perceiving that the men avoided speaking with her on serious business, she
      addressed herself to their mothers, wives, or daughters. In a letter to
      Marshal de Montmorency, then with the King, she thus refers to the Duke
      del Infantado, who had received her at his castle of Guadalaxara. &ldquo;You
      will tell the King that the Duke has been warned from the Court that if he
      wishes to please the Emperor neither he nor his son is to speak to me; but
      the ladies are not forbidden me, and to them I will speak twofold.&rdquo; (1)
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the negotiations for her brother&rsquo;s release Margaret always
      maintained the dignity and reserve fitting to her sex and situation.
      Writing to Francis on this subject she says: &ldquo;The Viceroy (Lannoy) has
      sent me word that he is of opinion I should go and see the Emperor, but I
      have told him through M. de Senlis that I have not yet stirred from my
      lodging without being asked, and that whenever it pleases the Emperor to
      see me I shall be found there.&rdquo; (2)

</pre>
    <p>
      Margaret was repeatedly admitted to the Imperial council to discuss the
      conditions of her brother&rsquo;s ransom. She showed as much ability as
      loftiness of mind on these occasions, and several times won Charles V.
      himself and the sternest of his Ministers to her opinion. (1)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1 Brantôme states that the Emperor was greatly impressed and
     astonished by her plain speaking. She reproached him for
     treating Francis so harshly, declaring that this course
     would not enable him to attain his ends. &ldquo;For although he
     (the King) might die from the effects of this rigorous
     treatment, his death would not remain unpunished, as he had
     children who would some day become men and wreak signal
     vengeance.&rdquo; &ldquo;These words,&rdquo; adds Brantôme, &ldquo;spoken so bravely
     and in such hot anger, gave the Emperor occasion for
     thought, insomuch that he moderated himself and visited the
     King and made him many fine promises, which he did not keep,
     however.&rdquo; With the Ministers Margaret was even more
     outspoken; but we are told that she turned her oratorical
     powers &ldquo;to such good purpose that she rendered herself
     agreeable rather than odious or unpleasant; the more readily
     as she was also good-looking, a widow, and in the flower of
     her age.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>OEuvres de Brantôme</i>, 8vo, vol. v. (<i>Les Dames
     illustres</i>).
</pre>
    <p>
      She highly favoured the proposed marriage between Francis and his rival&rsquo;s
      sister, Eleanor of Austria, detecting in this alliance the most certain
      means of a speedy release. Eleanor, born at Louvain in 1498, had in 1519
      married Emanuel, King of Portugal, who died two years afterwards. Since
      then she had been promised to the Constable de Bourbon, but the Emperor
      did not hesitate to sacrifice the latter to his own interests.
    </p>
    <p>
      He himself, being fascinated by Margaret&rsquo;s grace and wit, thought of
      marrying her, and had a letter sent to Louise of Savoy, plainly setting
      forth the proposal. In this missive, referring to the Constable de
      Bourbon, Charles remarked that &ldquo;there were good matches in France in
      plenty for him; for instance, Madame Renée, (1) with whom he might very
      well content himself.&rdquo; (2) These words have led to the belief that there
      had been some question of a marriage between Margaret and the Constable;
      however, there is no mention of any such alliance in the diplomatic
      documents exchanged between France and Spain on the subject of the King&rsquo;s
      release. These documents comprise an undertaking to restore the Constable
      his estates, and even to arrange a match for him in France, (3) but
      Margaret is never mentioned. She herself, in the numerous letters handed
      down to us, does not once refer to the famous exile, and the intrigue
      described by certain historians and romancers evidently rests upon no
      solid foundation. (4)

     4  Varillas is the principal historian who has mentioned
     this supposed intrigue, which also furnished the subject of
     a romance entitled <i>Histoire de Marguerite, Reine de
     Navarre, &amp;c.</i>, 1696.
</pre>
    <p>
      After three months of negotiations, continually broken off and renewed,
      Margaret and her brother, feeling convinced of Charles V.&lsquo;s evil
      intentions, resolved to take steps to ensure the independence of France.
      By the King&rsquo;s orders Robertet, his secretary, drew up letters-patent,
      dated November 1525 by which it was decreed that the young Dauphin should
      be crowned at once, and that the regency should continue in the hands of
      Louise of Savoy, but that in the event of her death the same power should
      be exercised by Francis&rsquo;s &ldquo;very dear and well-beloved only sister,
      Margaret of France, Duchess of Alençon and Berry.&rdquo; (1) However, all these
      provisions were to be deemed null and void in the event of Francis
      obtaining his release.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been erroneously alleged that Margaret on leaving Spain took this
      deed of abdication with her, and that the Emperor, informed of the
      circumstance, gave orders for her to be arrested as soon as her
      safe-conduct should expire. (2) However, it was the Marshal de Montmorency
      who carried the deed to France, and Charles V. in ordering the arrest of
      Margaret had no other aim than that of securing an additional hostage in
      case his treaty with Francis should not be fulfilled.

    <p>
      Margaret, pressed by her brother, at last asked for authorisation to leave
      Spain. By the manner in which the permission was granted she perceived
      that the Emperor wished to delay rather than hasten her journey. During
      November she wrote Francis a letter in which this conviction was plainly
      expressed, and about the 19th of the month she left Madrid upon her
      journey overland to France.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first she travelled very leisurely, but eventually she received a
      message from her brother, advising her to hasten her speed, as the
      Emperor, hoping that she would still be in Spain in January, when her
      safe-conduct would expire, had given orders for her arrest. Accordingly,
      on reaching Medina-Celi she quitted her litter and mounted on horseback,
      accomplishing the remainder of her journey in the saddle. Nine or ten days
      before the safe-conduct expired she passed Perpignan and reached Salces,
      where some French nobles were awaiting her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after her return to France she again took charge of the royal
      children, who once more fell ill, this time with the measles, as Margaret
      related in the following characteristic letter addressed to her brother,
      still a prisoner in Spain:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Lord,&mdash;The fear that I have gone through about your children,
      without saying anything of it to Madame (Louise of Savoy), who was also
      very ill, obliges me to tell you in detail the pleasure I feel at their
      recovery. M. d&rsquo;Angoulême caught the measles, with a long and severe fever;
      afterwards the Duke of Orleans took them with a little fever; and then
      Madame Madeleine without fever or pain; and by way of company the Dauphin
      without suffering or fever. And now they all are quite cured and very
      well; and the Dauphin does marvels in the way of studying, mingling with
      his schooling a hundred thousand other occupations. And there is no more
      question of passions, but rather of all the virtues; M. d&rsquo;Orléans is
      nailed to his book, and says that he wants to be good; but M. d&rsquo;Angoulême
      does more than the others, and says things that are to be esteemed rather
      as prophecies than childish utterances, which you, my lord, would be
      amazed to hear. Little Margot resembles myself; she will not be ill; but I
      am assured here that she has very graceful ways, and is getting prettier
      than ever Mademoiselle d&rsquo;Angoulême (1) was.&rdquo;

      Francis having consented to the onerous conditions imposed by Charles V.,
      was at last liberated. On March 17th, 1526, he was exchanged for his two
      elder sons, who were to serve as hostages for his good faith, and set foot
      upon the territory of Beam. He owed Margaret a deep debt of gratitude for
      her efforts to hasten his release, and one of his first cares upon leaving
      Spain was to wed her again in a fitting manner. He appears to have opened
      matrimonial negotiations with Henry VIII. of England, (1) but, fortunately
      for Margaret, without result. She, it seems, had already made her choice.
      There was then at the French Court a young King, without a kingdom, it is
      true, but endowed with numerous personal qualities. This was Henry
      d&rsquo;Albret, Count of Beam, and legitimate sovereign of Navarre, then held by
      Charles V. in defiance of treaty rights. Henry had been taken prisoner
      with Francis at Pavia and confined in the fortress there, from which,
      however, he had managed to escape in the following manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having procured a rope ladder in view of descending from the castle, he
      ordered Francis de Rochefort, his page, to get into his bed and feign
      sleep. Then he descended by the rope, the Baron of Arros and a valet
      following him. In the morning, when the captain on duty came to see Henry,
      as was his usual custom, he was asked by a page to let the King sleep on,
      as he had been very ill during the night. Thus the trick was only
      discovered when the greater part of the day had gone by, and the fugitives
      were already beyond pursuit. (2)

      As the young King of Navarre had spent a part of his youth at the French
      Court, he was well known to Margaret, who apparently had a secret fancy
      for him. He was in his twenty-fourth year, prepossessing, and extremely
      brave. (1) There was certainly a great disproportion of age between him
      and Margaret, but this must have served to increase rather than attenuate
      her passion. She herself was already thirty-five, and judging by a
      portrait executed about this period, (2) in which she is represented in
      mourning for the Duke of Alençon, with a long veil falling from her cap,
      her personal appearance was scarcely prepossessing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proposed alliance met with the approval of Francis, who behaved
      generously to his sister. He granted her for life the enjoyment of the
      duchies of Alençon and Berry, with the counties of Armagnac and Le Perche
      and several other lordships. Finally, the marriage was celebrated on
      January 24th, 1527, at St. Germain-en-Laye, where, as Sauvai records,
      &ldquo;there were jousts, tourneying, and great triumph for the space of eight
      days or thereabouts.&rdquo; (3)

    </p>
    <p>
      Some historians have stated that in wedding his sister to Henry d&rsquo;Albret,
      Francis pledged himself to compel Charles V. to surrender his
      brother-in-law&rsquo;s kingdom of Navarre. This, however, was but a political
      project, of which no deed guaranteed the execution. Francis no doubt
      promised Margaret to make every effort to further the restitution, and she
      constantly reminded him of his promise, as is shown by several of her
      letters. However, political exigencies prevented Francis from carrying out
      his plans, and in a diplomatic document concerning the release of the
      children whom Charles held as hostages the following clause occurs: &ldquo;Item,
      the said Lord King promises not to help or favour the King of Navarre
      (although he has married his only and dear beloved sister) in reconquering
      his kingdom.&rdquo; (1)
    </p>
    <p>
      The indifference shown by Francis for the political fortunes of his
      brother-in-law, despite the numerous and signal services the latter had
      rendered him, justly discontented Henry, who at last resolved to withdraw
      from the Court, where Montmorency, Brion, and several other personages,
      his declared enemies, were in favour. Margaret apparently had to follow
      her husband in his retirement, for Sainte-Marthe remarks: &ldquo;When the King
      of Navarre, disgusted with the Court, and seeing none of the promises that
      his brother-in-law had made him realised, resolved to withdraw to Beam,
      Margaret, although the keen air of the mountains was hurtful to her
      health, and her doctors had threatened her with a premature death if she
      persevered in braving the rigours of the climate, preferred to put her
      life in peril rather than to fail in her duty by not accompanying her
      husband.&rdquo; (2)
    </p>

</pre>
    <p>
      Various biographers express the opinion that this retirement took place in
      1529, shortly after the Peace of Cambray, and others give 1530 as the
      probable date. Margaret, we find, paid a flying visit to Beam with her
      husband in 1527; on January 7th, 1528, she was confined of her first
      child, Jane, at Fontainebleau, and the following year she is found with
      her little daughter at Longray, near Alençon. In 1530 she is confined at
      Blois of a second child, John, Prince of Viana, who died at Alençon on
      Christmas Day in the same year, when but five and a half months old. Then
      in 1531 her letters show her with her mother at Fontainebleau; and Louise
      of Savoy being stricken with the plague, then raging in France, Margaret
      closes her eyes at Gretz, a little village between Fontainebleau and
      Nemours, on September 22nd in that year.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was after this event that the King and Queen of Navarre determined to
      proceed to Beam, but so far as Margaret herself is concerned, it is
      certain that retirement was never of long duration whilst her brother
      lived. She is constantly to be found at Alençon, Fontainebleau, and Paris,
      being frequently with the King, who did not like to remain separated from
      her for any length of time. He was wont to initiate her into his political
      intrigues in view of availing himself of her keen and subtle mind.
      Brantôme, referring to this subject, remarks that her wisdom was such that
      the ambassadors who &ldquo;spoke to her were greatly charmed by it, and made
      great report of it to those of their nation on their return; in this
      respect she relieved the King her brother, for they (the ambassadors)
      always sought her after delivering the chief business of their embassy,
      and often when there was important business the King handed it over to
      her, relying upon her for its definite resolution. She understood very
      well how to entertain and satisfy the ambassadors with fine speeches, of
      which she was very lavish, and also very clever at worming their secrets
      out of them, for which reason the King often said that she helped him
      right well and relieved him of a great deal.&rdquo; (1)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1 <i>OEuvres de Brantôme</i>, 8vo, vol. v. p. 222.
</pre>
    <p>
      Margaret&rsquo;s own letters supply proof of this. She is constantly to be found
      intervening in state affairs and exercising her influence. She receives
      the deputies from Basle, Berne, and Strasburg who came to Paris in 1537 to
      ask Francis I. for the release of the imprisoned Protestants. She joins
      the King at Valence when he is making preparations for a fresh war against
      Charles V.; then she visits Montmorency at the camp of Avignon, which she
      praises to her brother; next, hastening to Picardy, when the Flemish
      troops are invading it, she writes from Amiens and speaks of Thérouenne
      and Boulogne, which she has found well fortified.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francis, however, did not value her society and counsel solely for
      political reasons; he was also fond of conversing with her on literature,
      and at times they composed amatory verses together. According to an
      oft-repeated tradition, one day at the Château of Chambord, whilst
      Margaret was boasting to her brother of the superiority of womankind in
      matters of love, the King took a diamond ring from his finger and wrote on
      one of the window panes this couplet:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Souvent femme varie, Bien fol est qui s&rsquo;y fie.&rdquo; (1)
</pre>
    <p>
      Brantôme, who declares that he saw the inscription, adds, however, that it
      consisted merely of three words, &ldquo;Toute femme varie&rdquo; (all women are
      fickle), inscribed in <i>large</i> letters at the side of the window. (2)
      He says nothing of any pane of glass (all window panes were then extremely
      <i>small</i>) or of a diamond having been used; (3) and in all probability
      Francis simply traced these words with a piece of chalk or charcoal on the
      side of one of the deep embrasures, which are still to be seen in the
      windows of the château.

     to have been resorted to until the close of the sixteenth

      Margaret carried her complaisance for her brother so far as to excuse his
      illicit amours, and she was usually on the best of terms with his
      favourites. (1) It has been asserted that improper relations existed
      between the brother and sister, but this charge rests solely upon an
      undated letter from her to Francis, which may be interpreted in a variety
      of ways. Count de la Ferrière, in his introduction to Margaret&rsquo;s record of
      her expenditure, (2) expresses the opinion that it was penned in 1525,
      prior to her hasty departure from Spain; while M. Le Roux de Lincy assigns
      it to a later date, remarking that it was probably written during one of
      the frequent quarrels which arose between Margaret&rsquo;s brother and her
      husband. However, they are both of opinion that the letter does not bear
      the interpretation which other writers have placed upon it. (3)

      The only really well-authenticated love intrigue in which Margaret was
      concerned&mdash;and in that she played a remarkably virtuous part&mdash;was
      her adventure with the Admiral de Bonnivet, upon which the fourth story of
      the <i>Heptameron</i> is based. (1) She was certainly unfortunate in both
      her marriages. Her life with the Duke of Alençon has already been spoken
      of; and as regards her second union, although contracted under apparently
      favourable auspices, it failed to yield Margaret the happiness she had
      hoped for. But four years after its celebration she wrote to the Marshal
      de Montmorency: &ldquo;Since you are with the King of Navarre, I have no fear
      but that all will go well, provided you can keep him from falling in love
      with the Spanish ladies.&rdquo; (2) And again: &ldquo;My nephew, I have received the
      letters you wrote to me, by which I have learnt that you are a much better
      relation than the King of Navarre is a good husband, for you alone have
      given me news of the King (Francis) and of him, without his being willing
      to give pleasure to a poor wife, big with child, by writing a single word
      to her.&rdquo; (3)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">

     the notes to Tale iv., and also in the Appendix to the

    <p>
      In another letter written to the Marshal at the same period she says: &ldquo;If
      you listen to the King of Navarre, he will make you commit so many
      disorders that he will ruin you.&rdquo; (1) Perhaps these words should not be
      taken literally; still they furnish cause for reflection when it is
      remembered that they were written by a woman just turned forty concerning
      her husband who was not yet thirty years old.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret&rsquo;s views upon love and the affinity of souls were somewhat
      singular, but they indicate an elevated and generous nature. In several
      passages of the <i>Heptameron</i> she has expressed her opinion on these
      matters, ardently defending the honour of her sex and condemning those
      wives who show themselves indulgent as regards their husbands&rsquo;
      infidelities. (2) She blames those who sow dissension between husbands and
      wives, leading them on to blows; (3) and when some one asked her what she
      understood perfect love to be, she made answer, &ldquo;I call perfect lovers
      those who seek some perfection in the object of their love, be it beauty,
      kindness, or good grace, tending to virtue, and who have such high and
      honest hearts that they will not even for fear of death do base things
      that honour and conscience blame.&rdquo;

    <p>
      In reference to this subject of conjugal fidelity a curious story is told
      of Margaret. One day at Mont-de-Marsan, upon seeing a young man convicted
      of having murdered his father being led to execution, she remarked to
      those about her that it was very wrong to put to death a young fellow who
      had not committed the crime imputed to him. It was pointed out to her that
      the judges had only condemned him upon conclusive proofs and the
      acknowledgments that he himself had made. Margaret, however, persisted in
      her remark, whereupon some of her intimates begged of her to justify it,
      for it seemed to them at least singular. &ldquo;I do not doubt,&rdquo; she replied,
      &ldquo;that this poor wretch killed his mother&rsquo;s husband, but he certainly did
      not kill his own father.&rdquo; (1)
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides being unfortunate as regards her husbands, Margaret was also
      denied a mother&rsquo;s privileges. She experienced great suffering at her
      confinements, (2) and on two occasions she was delivered of still-born
      infants of the female sex.

      She had centred many hopes upon her little boy, John, of whom she was
      confined without accident, but he died, as already stated, in infancy, and
      this misfortune was a great shock to her, though she tried to conceal it
      by having the Te Deum sung at the funeral in lieu of the ordinary service,
      and by setting up in the streets of Alençon the inscription, &ldquo;God gave
      him, God has taken him away.&rdquo; However, from that time forward she never
      laid aside her black dress, though later on she wore it trimmed with
      marten&rsquo;s fur. Her best known portrait (1) represents her attired in this
      style with the quaint Bearnese cap, which she had also adopted, set upon
      her head.

    <p>
      Not only did Margaret lose her son by death, but she was prevented from
      enjoying the companionship of her daughter Jane. Francis, who never once
      lost sight of his own interests, deemed it advisable to possess himself of
      this child, who was the heiress to the throne of Navarre. Accordingly when
      Jane was but two years old she was sent by the King to the Château of
      Plessis-lès-Tours, where she was carefully brought up in strict seclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the fact that Margaret was never really happy with either of her
      husbands, and that she was precluded from discharging a mother&rsquo;s duties,
      one may ascribe, in part, her fondness for gathering round her a Court in
      which divines, scholars, and wits prominently figured. The great interest
      which she took in religious matters, as is shown by so many of her
      letters, (1) led her to shelter many of the persecuted Reformers in Beam;
      others she saved from the stake, and frequently in writing to the King and
      Marshal de Montmorency she begs for the release of some imprisoned
      heretic.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1 One of these letters, written by her either to Philiberta
     of Savoy, Duchess of Nemours, or to Charlotte d&rsquo;Orléans,
     Duchess of Nemours, both of whom were her aunts, may be thus
     rendered in English: &ldquo;My aunt, on leaving Paris to escort
     the King, Monsieur de Meaux (Bishop Briçonnet), sent me the
     Gospels in French, translated by Fabry, word for word, which
     he says we should read with as much reverence and as much
     preparation to receive the Spirit of God, such as He has
     left it us in His Holy Scriptures, as when we go to receive
     it in the form of Sacrament. And inasmuch as Monsieur de
     Villeroy has promised to deliver them to you, I have
     requested him to do so, for these words (the Gospels) must
     not fall into evil hands. I beg, my aunt, that if by their
     means God grants you some grace, you will not forget her who
     is above all else your good niece and sister, Margaret.&rdquo;
      Fabry&rsquo;s translation of the Gospels was made in 1523-24.
</pre>
    <p>
      Margaret&rsquo;s religious views frequently caused dissension between her and
      her husband, in whose presence she abstained from giving expression to
      them. Hilarion de Coste mentions that &ldquo;King Henry having one day been
      informed that a form of prayer and instruction contrary to that of his
      fathers was held in the chamber of the Queen, his wife, entered it
      intending to chastise the minister, and finding that he had been hurried
      away, the remains of his anger fell upon his wife, who received a blow
      from him, he remarking, &lsquo;Madam, you want to know too much about it,&rsquo; and
      he at once sent word of the matter to King Francis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was at Nérac that most of the divines protected by Margaret found a
      refuge from the persecutions of the Sorbonne. Here she kept court in a
      castle of which there now only remains a vaulted fifteenth-century gallery
      formerly belonging to the northern wing. Nérac has, however, retained
      intact a couple of quaint mediaeval bridges, which Margaret must have
      ofttimes crossed in her many journeyings. Moreover, the townsfolk still
      point out the so-called Palace of Marianne, said to have been built by
      Margaret&rsquo;s husband for one of his mistresses, and also the old royal
      baths, which the Queen no doubt frequented.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at the castle of Nérac that Margaret&rsquo;s favourite protégé, the
      venerable Lefèvre d&rsquo;Étaples, died at the age of one hundred and one, in
      the presence of his patroness, to whom before expiring he declared that he
      had never known a woman carnally in his life. However, he regretfully
      added that in his estimation he had been guilty of a greater sin, for he
      had neglected to lay down his life for his faith. Another partisan of the
      Reform, Gerard Roussel, whom Margaret had almost snatched from the stake
      and appointed Bishop of Oloron, had no occasion to express any such
      regret. His own flock speedily espoused the doctrines of the Reformation,
      but when he proceeded to Mauléon and tried to preach there, the Basques
      refused to listen to him, and hacked the pulpit to pieces, the Bishop
      being precipitated upon the flagstones, and so grievously injured that he
      died.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beside the divines who sought an asylum at Nérac, there were various noted
      men of letters, foremost among whom we may class the Queen&rsquo;s two
      secretaries, Clement Marot, the poet, and Peter Le Maçon, the translator
      of Boccaccio&rsquo;s <i>Decameron</i>. This translation was undertaken at the
      Queen&rsquo;s request, as Le Maçon states in his dedication to her, and it has
      always been considered one of the most able literary works of the period.
      With Marot and Le Maçon, but in the more humble capacity of valet, at the
      yearly wages of one hundred and ten livres, there came the gay Bonaventure
      Despériers, the author of <i>Les Joyeux Devis</i>; (1) other writers, such
      as John Frotté, John de la Haye and Gabriel Chapuis, were also among
      Margaret&rsquo;s retainers.

      She herself had long practised the writing of verses. It was in 1531, and
      at Alençon, that she issued her first volume of poems, the <i>Miroir de
      l&rsquo;Ame Pécheresse</i>, (1) which created a great stir at the time, for when
      it was re-issued in Paris by Augereau in 1533 (2) the Sorbonne denounced
      it as unorthodox, and Margaret would have been branded as a heretic if
      Francis had not intervened and ordered the Rector of the Sorbonne to
      withdraw the decree censuring his sister&rsquo;s work. Nor did that content the
      King, for he caused Noël Béda, the syndic of the Faculty of Theology, to
      be arrested and confined in a dungeon at Mont St. Michel, where he
      perished miserably.

     year.
</pre>
    <p>
      Margaret thus gained the day, but the annoyance she had been subjected to
      doubtless taught her to be prudent, for although she steadily went on
      writing, sixteen years elapsed before any more of her poems were
      published. In the meantime various manuscript copies, some of which are
      still in existence, were made of them, notably one of the poem called
      &ldquo;Débat d&rsquo;Amour&rdquo; by Margaret, and re-christened &ldquo;La Coche&rdquo; by her
      secretary, John de la Haye, when he subsequently published it in the <i>Marguerites
      de la Marguerite</i>. This manuscript is enriched with eleven curious
      miniatures, the last of which represents the Queen handing the volume
      bound in white velvet (1) to the Duchess of Etampes, her brother&rsquo;s
      mistress, whose qualities the poem extols. The Queen of Navarre was on the
      best of terms with this favourite, to whom in one of her letters she
      recommends certain servants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret was not only given to versifying, but was fond of&rsquo; framing
      devices, which she inscribed upon her books and furniture. At one time she

      motto, &ldquo;Non inferiora secutus,&rdquo; implying that she turned &ldquo;all her acts,
      thoughts, will, and affections towards the great Sun of Justice, God
      Almighty.&rdquo; (2)

     1  From the Queen&rsquo;s <i>Livre de Dépenses</i>, published by M. de
     la Ferrière, we learn that this MS., with the miniatures and
     binding, cost Margaret fifty golden crowns. It was formerly
     in the possession of M. Jérôme Pichon, and was afterwards
     acquired by M. Didot, at the sale of whose library it
     realised £804. The MS. was recently in the possession of M.
     de La Roche-la-Carelle.

    <p>
      In her <i>Miroir de l&rsquo;Ame Pécheresse</i>, previously referred to, there
      figures another device composed merely of the three words &ldquo;Ung pour tout;&rdquo;
       and in the manuscript of &ldquo;La Coche&rdquo; presented to the Duchess of Etampes,
      the motto &ldquo;Plus vous que moys&rdquo; is inscribed beneath each of the
      miniatures. Margaret also composed a series of devices for some jewels
      which her brother presented to his favourite, Madame de Châteaubriant.
      Respecting these Brantôme tells the following curious anecdote:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard say, and hold on good authority, that when King Francis I.
      had left Madame de Châteaubriant, his favourite mistress, to take Madame
      d&rsquo;Etampes, as one nail drives out another, Madame d&rsquo;Etampes begged the
      King to take back from the said Madame de Châteaubriant all the finest
      jewels that he had given her, not on account of their cost and value, for
      pearls and precious stones were not then so fashionable as they have been
      since, but for the love of the fine devices that were engraved and
      impressed upon them; which devices the Queen of Navarre, his sister, had
      made and composed, for she was a mistress in such matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;King Francis granted the request, and promised that he would do it.
      Having with this intent sent a gentleman to Madame de Châteaubriant to ask
      for the jewels, she at once feigned illness, and put the gentleman off for
      three days, when he was to have what he asked for. However, out of spite,
      she sent for a goldsmith, and made him melt down all these jewels without
      exception, and without having any respect for the handsome devices
      engraved upon them. And afterwards, when the said gentleman returned, she
      gave him all the jewels converted into gold ingots.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Go,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;and take these to the King, and tell him that since he
      has been pleased to take back from me that which he had given me so
      freely, I restore it and send it back in golden ingots. As for the
      devices, I have impressed them so firmly on my mind and hold them so dear
      in it, that I could not let any one have and enjoy them save myself.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When the King had received all this, the ingots and the lady&rsquo;s remark, he
      only said, &lsquo;Take her back all. What I did was not for the value, for I
      would have restored her that twofold, but for the love of the devices, and
      since she has thus destroyed them, I do not want the gold, and send it
      back. She has shown in this matter more courage and generosity than it
      would have been thought could come from a woman.&rsquo;&rdquo; (1)
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides writing verses and framing devices, Margaret, as Brantôme tells
      us, &ldquo;often composed comedies and moralities, which were in those days
      styled pastorals, and which she had played by the young ladies of her
      Court.&rdquo; (2)

</pre>
    <p>
      Hilarion de Coste states, moreover, that &ldquo;she composed a tragi-comic
      translation of almost the whole of the New Testament, which she caused to
      be played before the King, her husband, having assembled with this object
      some of the best actors of Italy; and as these buffoons are only born to
      give pleasure and make time pass away, in order to amuse the company they
      invariably introduced <i>rondeaux</i> and <i>virelais</i> against the
      ecclesiastics, especially the monks and village priests.&rdquo; (1)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1 M. Le Roux de Lincy points out that this statement is
     exaggerated, for Margaret, instead of turning the whole of
     the New Testament into verse, merely wrote four Mysteries
     which mainly dealt with the childhood of Christ.
</pre>
    <p>
      These performances took place at the Château of Pau, which Margaret and
      her husband seem to have preferred to that of Nérac, though political
      reasons often compelled them to fix their abode at the latter. Pau,
      however, possessed the advantage of a mild climate, necessary for
      Margaret&rsquo;s health, besides being delightfully situated on the Bearnese
      Gave, the view from the château extending over a fertile valley limited by
      the snow-capped Pyrenees. There had been a château at Pau as early as the
      tenth century, but the oldest portions of the structure now subsisting
      date from the time of Edward III., when Pau was the capital of the
      celebrated Gaston-Phoebus. The château was considerably enlarged and
      embellished in the fifteenth century, but it was not until after
      Margaret&rsquo;s marriage with Henry d&rsquo;Albret that the more remarkable
      decorative work was executed. Upon leaving Nérac to reside at Pau,
      Margaret summoned a number of Italian artists and confided the
      embellishment of the château to them.(1)
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not, however, merely the château which Margaret beautified at Pau.
      Already at Alençon she had laid out a charming park, which a contemporary
      poet called a terrestrial paradise,(2) and upon coming to reside at Pau
      she transformed the surrounding woods into delightful gardens, pronounced
      to be the finest then existing in Europe.(3)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1 Some of the doors and windows of the château are
     elaborately ornamented in the best style of the Renaissance,
     whilst the grand staircase, although dating from Margaret&rsquo;s
     time, has vaulted arches, sometimes in the Romanesque and at
     others in the Gothic style. Entwined on the friezes are the
     initials H and M (Henry and Margaret), occasionally
     accompanied by the letter R, implying <i>Rex</i> or <i>Regina</i>. On
     the first floor of the chateau is the bedroom occupied by
     Margaret&rsquo;s husband, remarkable for its Renaissance chimney-
     piece, and also a grand reception hall, now adorned with
     tapestry made for Francis I. in Flanders. It was in this
     latter room that the Count of Montgomery&mdash;the same who had
     thrust out the eye of Henry II. at a tournament, and thereby
     caused that monarch&rsquo;s death&mdash;acting at the instigation of
     Margaret&rsquo;s daughter Jane, assembled the Catholic noblemen of
     Beam on August 24, 1569, and, after entertaining them with a
     banquet, had them treacherously massacred. Bascle de

      Some idea of their appearance may be gained from a couple of the
      miniatures adorning a curious manuscript catechism composed for Margaret
      and now in the Arsenal Library at Paris.(1)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  <i>Manuscrits théologiques français</i>, No. 60, <i>Initiatoire
     Instruction en la Religion chrétienne, &amp;c</i>. In one of these
     miniatures the Saviour is represented carrying the cross,
     followed by Henry of Navarre, his brother Charles d&rsquo;Albret,
     Margaret, and other personages, all of whom bear crosses,
     whilst in the background are some pleasure-grounds with a
     castle, a little waterfall, and a lake. Another miniature in
     the same manuscript shows King Henry of Navarre with a
     flower in his hand, which he seems to be offering to the
     Queen, who stands in the background among a party of
     courtiers. The King wears a surtout of cloth of gold, edged
     with ermine, over a blue jerkin, and a red cap with a white
     feather. Margaret is also arrayed in cloth of gold, but with
     a black cap and wimple. She is standing in a garden enclosed
     by a railing, and adorned with a fountain in the form of a
     temple which rises among groves and arbours. Beyond a white
     crenellated wall is a castle which has been identified with
     that of Pau. On fol. 1 of the same MS. the artist has
     depicted Queen Margaret&rsquo;s escutcheon, by which we find that
     she quartered the arms of France with those of Navarre,
     Aragon, Castile, Leon, Beam, Bigorre, Evreux, and Albret.
</pre>
    <p>
      The Court which Margaret kept in turns at Alençon, Nérac, and Pau does not
      appear to have been so sumptuous and gay as some of her biographers
      assert. Brantôme mentions that the Queen&rsquo;s two tables were always served
      with frugality, and Sainte-Marthe states that &ldquo;she talked at dinner and
      supper now of medicine, of food wholesome or unwholesome for the human
      body, and of objects of nature with Masters Schyron, Cormier, and
      Esterpin, her expert and learned doctors, who carefully watched her eat
      and drink, as is done with princes; now she would speak of history or of
      the precepts of philosophy with other very erudite personages, with whom
      her house was never unfurnished; at another time she would enter into
      conversation on her faith and the Christian religion with Monsieur Gerard,
      Bishop of Oloron. Altogether there was not a single moment that was not
      employed by her in honest, pleasant, and useful conversation.&rdquo; (1)
    </p>
    <p>
      The same panegyrist tells us of Margaret&rsquo;s favourite occupations,
      mentioning that when she was alone in her room she more often held a book
      in her hand than a distaff, a pen than a spindle, and the ivory of her
      tablets than a needle. He then adds: &ldquo;And if she applied herself to
      tapestry or other needlework, such as was to her a pleasant occupation,
      she had beside her some one who read to her, either from a historian or a
      poet, or some other notable and useful author; or else she dictated some
      meditation which was written down.&rdquo; (2)

    <p>
      Margaret&rsquo;s time was far from being wholly occupied in this manner, for she
      actively assisted her husband in carrying out improvements and reforms in
      Beam. The result was that the country, naturally good and fertile, but
      left in bad condition, uncultivated and sterile through the carelessness
      of its inhabitants, soon changed its appearance owing to the efforts of
      Henry and his wife. From all the provinces of France labourers were
      attracted who settled there and improved and fertilised the fields.(1)

      Henry d&rsquo;Albret also devoted himself to the placing of the country in a
      proper state of defence, and fortified several of the towns. Navarreinx,
      commanding the valley of the Gave of Oloron, was virtually rebuilt by him
      and transformed into a perfect stronghold, as was evidenced during the
      religious wars, when it successfully withstood the artillery of Terrade,
      the Catholic commander. Long afterwards, when Vauban inaugurated his new
      system of fortification, he came to Navarreinx, and on seeing the ramparts
      raised by Margaret&rsquo;s husband was so favourably impressed, that instead of
      levelling them to the ground he contented himself with adding to them and
      making various improvements. Henry d&rsquo;Albret was also anxious to refortify
      Sauveterre, which the Prince of Orange, with one of the Imperial armies,
      had captured in 1523, when he half-demolished the old castle of Montreal,
      then the most formidable citadel in Beam. However, as time and money were
      lacking, Henry had to abandon his plans, and the ruins left by the
      Imperialists, the ivy-clad keep, and mutilated bridge over the Gave soon
      fell into irremediable decay.(1)

</pre>
    <p>
      Whilst Margaret was living amongst divines and scholars at Pau and Nérac,
      her mind, as her letters indicate, constantly turned to her daughter Jane,
      whom Aimée de la Fayette, wife of the Bailiff of Caen, was bringing up at
      Plessis-lès-Tours. Margaret was only able to see Jane at rare intervals
      during some of her trips to France, and she was mainly indebted to
      sympathising friends for news of the little Princess&rsquo;s condition and
      health. All her maternal tenderness was concentrated on this daughter, and
      whenever the child was ailing she became distracted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sainte-Marthe records that in December 1537, while Margaret was sojourning
      in Paris, her daughter, then scarcely nine years old, fell seriously ill
      at the royal house of Plessis-lès-Tours; and as it was rumoured amongst
      the Court, then at Paris, that the Princess was threatened with death, her
      virtuous mother, Margaret, at about four o&rsquo;clock in the evening, ordered
      her litter to be brought, saying that she would go and see her daughter,
      and that all her people should prepare to start. There was nothing ready,
      the officials and servants were absent, and scattered about the town of
      Paris and the neighbouring villages. It was already dark, for this was
      during the shortest days of the year, the weather too was adverse on
      account of the rain, and neither her litter nor her baggage mules were at
      hand. Seeing this, the courageous Queen borrowed the litter of Madame
      Margaret, her niece,(1) got in it, and contenting herself with scant
      escort, started from Paris and went as far as Bourg-la-Reine.

    <p>
      &ldquo;When they had arrived there she did not alight at her lodgings, but went
      straight to the church, which she at once entered, saying to those about
      her, that her heart told her I know not what concerning her daughter&rsquo;s
      fate, and affectionately begging them all to withdraw and leave her alone
      for an hour in the church. All obeyed and in great uneasiness waited for
      their mistress at the church door; the Sénéchale de Poitou,(1) a very
      faithful lady, and very solicitous about Margaret, alone entering with
      her. Margaret having gone in, kneels down before the image of Jesus
      crucified, prays to God from the depths of her heart, sighs, weeps,
      confesses all her transgressions, and laying to herself alone the cause of
      her daughter&rsquo;s illness, humbly asks pardon, and begs that the sufferer&rsquo;s
      restoration to health may be granted. After this act of faith Margaret
      felt relieved, and she had scarcely arrived at her lodgings when the
      Bishop of Mende came to announce to her that her daughter was in the way
      of recovery.&rdquo; (2)

    <p>
      When Jane was barely twelve years old Charles V. asked her in marriage for
      his son Philip, but Francis, who was by no means anxious to see the
      Spaniards established on the northern side of the Pyrenees, preferred that
      the girl should marry William III., Duke of Cleves. It has frequently been
      asserted that Francis on this occasion exercised compulsion not only upon
      his niece, but also upon the King and Queen of Navarre, who vainly
      protested against this abuse of power. The truth is, that Margaret not
      only favoured the marriage, but threatened to have Jane whipped if she
      persisted in her refusal. Moreover, the little bride having declared to
      Francis I. that she protested against the alliance, Margaret wrote to her
      brother as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Lord, in my extreme desolation, I have only one single comfort, it is
      that of knowing with certainty that neither the King of Navarre nor myself
      have ever had any other wish or intention than that of obeying you, not
      only as regards a marriage, but in whatever you might order. But now, my
      lord, having heard that my daughter, neither recognising the great honour
      you do her in deigning to visit her, nor the obedience that she owes you,
      nor that a girl should have no will of her own, has spoken to you so madly
      as to say to you that she begged of you she might not be married to M. de
      Cleves, I do not know, my lord, either what I ought to think of it, or
      what I ought to say to you about it, for I am grieved to the heart, and
      have neither relative nor friend in the world from whom I can seek advice
      or consolation. And the King of Navarre is on his part so amazed and
      grieved at it that I have never seen him before so provoked. I cannot
      imagine whence comes this great boldness, of which she had never spoken to
      us. She excuses herself towards us in that she is more intimate with you
      than with ourselves, but this intimacy should not give rise to such
      boldness, without ever as I know seeking advice from any one, for if I
      knew any creature who had put such an idea into her head, I would make
      such a demonstration that you, my lord, would know that this madness is
      contrary to the will of the father and mother, who have never had, and
      never will have, any other than your own.&rdquo; (1)
    </p>
    <p>
      The rebellion of Jane did not prevent the marriage, which was solemnised
      at Châtelherault on July 15th, 1540. According to some authorities,
      Francis was so determined upon the alliance that he required the Duke of
      Cleves to enter his bride&rsquo;s bed in the presence of witnesses, so that the
      marriage should be deemed beyond annulment.(2)

<pre xml:space="preserve">

     however, was not really consummated (<i>Nouvelles Lettres,
     &amp;c.</i>, pp. 236, 237), and it was eventually annulled by Pope
     Paul III., to whom Francis applied for a divorce when the
     Duke of Cleves deserted his cause for that of Charles V.
</pre>
    <p>
      It was at Châtelherault on this occasion that Margaret triumphed over the
      Constable de Montmorency, who in earlier years had been her close friend,
      and with whom she had carried on such a voluminous correspondence.
      Montmorency had requited her good services with ingratitude, repeatedly
      endeavouring to estrange Francis from her. Brantôme gives an instance of
      this in the following passage:&mdash;&ldquo;I have heard related,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;by
      a person of good faith that the Constable de Montmorency, then in the
      highest favour, speaking of this matter of religion one day with the King,
      made no difficulty or scruple about telling him, that &lsquo;if he really wished
      to exterminate the heretics of his kingdom, he ought to begin at his Court
      and with his nearest relatives, mentioning the Queen his sister,&rsquo; to which
      the King replied, &lsquo;Do not speak of her; she loves me too much. She will
      never believe anything save what I believe, and will never take up a
      religion prejudicial to the State.&rsquo;&rdquo; (1)

    <p>
      As soon as Margaret became aware of Montmorency&rsquo;s conduct she ceased all
      correspondence with him and steadily endeavoured to effect his overthrow,
      which was brought about on the occasion of Jane&rsquo;s marriage. &ldquo;It was
      necessary to carry the little bride to the church,&rdquo; says Brantôme, &ldquo;as she
      was laden with jewels and a dress of gold and silver, and owing to this
      and the weakness of her body, was not able to walk. So the King ordered
      the Constable to take his little niece and carry her to the church, at
      which all the Court were greatly astonished, for at such a ceremony this
      was a duty little suited and honourable for a Constable, and might very
      well have been given to another. However, the Queen of Navarre was in no
      way displeased, but said, &lsquo;Behold! he who wished to ruin me with the King
      my brother now serves to carry my daughter to church.&rsquo; The Constable,&rdquo;
       adds Brantôme, &ldquo;was greatly displeased at the task, and sorely vexed to
      serve as such a spectacle to every one; and he began to say, &lsquo;It is now
      all over with my favour. Farewell to it.&rsquo; Thus it happened, for after the
      wedding festival and dinner he had his dismissal and left at once.&rdquo; (1)
    </p>
    <p>
      After the marriage of her daughter Margaret returned to Paris, and thence
      repaired to Mont-de-Marsan to spend the winter of 1540-41. Late in the
      following spring she went to Cauterets in the Pyrenees to take the baths.
      Writing during Lent to her brother she states that her husband having had
      a fall will repair to Cauterets by the advice of his doctors,(2) and that
      she intends to accompany him to prevent him from worrying and to transact
      his business for him, &ldquo;for when one is at the baths one must live like a
      child without any care.&rdquo; (3)

      This was not her only motive in going to Cauterets apparently, for in a
      letter to Duke William of Cleves, her daughter&rsquo;s husband, dated April
      1541, she states that as she is suffering from a <i>caterre</i> which &ldquo;has
      fallen upon half her neck,&rdquo; and compels her to keep her bed, the doctors
      have advised her to take &ldquo;the natural baths,&rdquo; and hope that she will be
      cured by the end of May, providing she follows all their prescriptions.(1)

      That this visit to Cauterets left a deep impression upon the mind of
      Margaret is evidenced by the work upon which her literary fame rests. The
      scene selected for the prologue of the <i>Heptameron</i> is Cauterets and
      the surrounding country; still it is evident that the book was not
      commenced upon the occasion referred to, for in the prologue Margaret
      alludes to historical events which took place in 1543 and 1544, and she
      speaks of them as being of recent occurrence at her time of writing. Now
      we know that in April 1544 she met her brother at Alençon, and made a long
      stay in the duchy, and the probability is that she commenced the <i>Heptameron</i>
      at that time. It was the work of several years, penned in a desultory
      style whilst Margaret was travelling about her northern duchy or her
      southern kingdom. Like all persons of high station, she journeyed in a
      litter, and Brantôme informs us that her equipage was a modest one, for
      &ldquo;she never had more than three baggage-mules and six for her two litters,
      though she had two, three, or four chariots for her ladies.&rdquo; (1) Brantôme&mdash;who
      it may be mentioned was brought up at Margaret&rsquo;s Court under the care of
      his grandmother, Louise de Daillon, wife of Andrew de Vivonne, Seneschal
      of Poitou&mdash;also states that the Queen composed the <i>Heptameron</i>
      mainly &ldquo;in her litter, while journeying about, for she had more important
      occupations when she was at home. I have thus heard it related by my
      grandmother, who always went with her in her litter as her lady of honour,
      and held the escritoire with which she wrote, and she set them (the
      stories) down in writing as speedily and skilfully as if they had been
      dictated to her, if not more so.&rdquo; (2)

      In 1545 and 1546 we find Margaret in Beam, whence she addresses New Year
      epistles to her brother expressing her sorrow at being separated from him.
      In the spring of the latter year she visits him at Plessis-lès-Tours. The
      King of France&mdash;contrary to all tradition&mdash;enjoys at this period
      as good health as the most robust man in his kingdom.(1) In 1547 Margaret
      repairs to a convent at Tusson in the Angoumois to spend Lent there, and
      soon afterwards is despatching courier after courier to the Court at
      Rambouillet for news of Francis, who is dying. Such is her anguish of
      suspense that she exclaims, &ldquo;Whoever comes to my door to announce to me
      the cure of the King my brother, were such a messenger weary, tired,
      muddy, and dirty, I would embrace and kiss him like the cleanest prince
      and gentleman in France; and if he lacked a bed and could not find one to
      repose upon, I would give him mine, and would sleep on the floor for the
      sake of the good news he brought me.&rdquo; (2)

    <p>
      No one, however, had the courage to tell her the truth. It was a poor
      maniac who by her tears gave her to understand that the King was no longer
      alive. Sainte-Marthe records the incident as follows: &ldquo;Now the day that
      Francis was taken away from us (Margaret herself has since told me so),
      she thought whilst sleeping that she saw him looking pale, and calling for
      her in a sad voice, which she took for a very evil sign; and feeling
      doubtful about it, she sent several messengers to the Court to ascertain
      the condition of the King her brother, but not a single one of them
      returned to her. One day, her brother having again appeared to her while
      she was asleep (he had already been dead fifteen days), (1) she asked the
      members of her household if they had heard any news of the King.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1 Francis I. died March 31, 1547.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They replied to her that he was very well, and she then went to the
      church. On her way there she summoned Thomas le Coustellier, a young man
      of good intelligence and her secretary, and as she was telling him the
      substance of a letter that she wished to write to a Princess of the Court,
      to obtain from her some news of the King&rsquo;s health, she heard on the other
      side of the cloister a nun, whose brain was somewhat turned, lamenting and
      weeping loudly. Margaret, naturally inclined to pity, hastened to this
      woman, asked her why she was weeping, and encouraged her to tell her
      whether she wished for anything. Then the nun began to lament still more
      loudly, and looking at the Queen, told her that she was deploring her
      ill-fortune. When Margaret heard these words she turned towards those who
      were with her, and said to them, &lsquo;You were hiding the King&rsquo;s death from
      me, but the Spirit of God has revealed it to me through this maniac.&rsquo; This
      said, she turned to her room, knelt down, and humbly thanked the Lord for
      all the goodness He was pleased to show her.&rdquo; (1)
    </p>
    <p>
      After losing her brother, Margaret remained in retirement at the convent
      of Tusson. She stayed there, says Brantôme, for four months, leading a
      most austere life and discharging the duties of abbess. She still
      continued in retirement on her return to Beam, mainly occupying herself
      with literary work. It was in 1547, subsequent to the death of Francis,
      that John de la Haye, her secretary, published at Lyons her <i>Marguerites
      de la Marguerite</i>, poems which she had composed at various periods, and
      which De la Haye probably transcribed at her dictation.(2)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  <i>Oraison funèbre, &amp;c.</i>, p. 103.

     2  Sainte-Marthe states that she would sit with two
     secretaries, one on either side, and dictate poetry to the
     one and letters to the other.
</pre>
    <p>
      Margaret&rsquo;s daughter Jane was at this period at the Court of France, living
      in extravagant style, as is shown by the letters in which Margaret
      declares that the Princess&rsquo;s expenditure is insupportable. She herself
      spent but little money upon personal needs, though she devoted
      considerable sums to charity. In October 1548 she emerged from her
      seclusion to attend the second marriage of her daughter, who now became
      the wife of Anthony de Bourbon, Duke of Vendôme. From Moulins, where the
      ceremony took place, Margaret repaired to the Court at Fontainebleau. Here
      all was changed: there was a new King, and Diana of Poitiers occupied the
      position of the Duchess of Etampes. After returning to Beam for Christmas,
      Margaret spent the Lent of 1549 in retreat at Tusson, where she apparently
      divided her time between prayer and literary labour. She was still writing
      the <i>Heptameron</i>, as is shown by the sixty-sixth tale, which
      chronicles an adventure that befell her daughter and Anthony de Bourbon on
      their marriage trip during the winter of 1548-49. It may be noted, too,
      that the scene of the sixty-ninth story is laid at the Castle of Odos near
      Tarbes, and as Margaret came to reside at the castle in the autumn of
      1549, this tale was probably written during her sojourn there. Whilst
      adding fresh stories to the <i>Heptameron</i>, she was not neglecting
      poetry, for from this period also dates the <i>Miroir de Jésus Christ
      crucifié</i>, which Brother Olivier published in 1556, stating that it was
      the Queen&rsquo;s last work, and that she had handed it to him a few days before
      her death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret had long been in failing health and was growing extremely weak.
      Brantôme, on the authority of his grandmother, states that when her
      approaching death was announced to her, she found the monition a very
      bitter one, saying that she was not yet so aged but that she might live
      some years longer. She was then in her fifty-eighth year. Sainte-Marthe
      relates that shortly before her death she saw in a dream a very beautiful
      woman holding in her hand a crown of all sorts of flowers which she showed
      to her, telling her that she would soon be crowned with it.(1)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1 <i>Oraison funèbre, &amp;c.</i>, p. 104.
</pre>
    <p>
      She interpreted this dream as signifying that her end was near, and from
      that day forward abandoned the administration of her property to the King
      of Navarre, refusing to occupy herself with any other matter than that of
      her approaching end. After dictating her will she fell into her final
      illness, which lasted twenty days according to some authorities, and eight
      according to others. It seized her one night at Odos whilst she was
      watching a comet, which it was averred had appeared to notify the death of
      Pope Paul III. &ldquo;It was perhaps to presage her own,&rdquo; naively remarks
      Brantôme, who adds that while she was looking at the comet her mouth
      suddenly became partially paralysed, whereupon her doctor, M. d&rsquo;Escuranis,
      led her away and made her go to bed. Her death took place on December
      21st, 1549, and just before expiring she grasped a crucifix that lay
      beside her and murmured, &ldquo;Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.&rdquo; (1)
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the King of Navarre had not always lived in perfect accord with
      his wife, he none the less keenly felt the loss he had sustained by her
      death. Olhagaray represents him when deprived of Margaret as no longer
      showing the same firm purpose of life, but as sad, discontented, and
      altering his plans at every trifle.(2) He gave orders that Margaret&rsquo;s
      remains should be interred in the Cathedral of Lescar, some four and a
      half miles from the Château of Pau, with which it is said to have been at
      that time connected by a subterranean passage. Several of the Navarrese
      sovereigns had already been buried there, for the See was a kind of
      primacy, the Bishops being <i>ex-officio</i> presidents of the States of
      Beam.(3)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  M. Lalanne, in his edition of Brantôme&rsquo;s works, maintains
     that Margaret did not die at Odos, near Tarbes, but at
     Audaux, near Orthez, basing this contention on the fact that
     Brantôme calls the castle &ldquo;Audos in Beam,&rdquo; and that Odos is
     in Bigorre. Tradition, however, has always pointed to the
     latter locality, though, on the other hand, it is stated
     that less than half a century after Margaret&rsquo;s death Odos
     was nothing but a ruin, and had long been in that condition.
     In 1596 Henry IV. gave the property to John de Lassalle, by
     whose descendants the château was restored (Bascle de
     Lagrèze&rsquo;s <i>Chateau de Pau, &amp;c.</i>).

     2  <i>Histoire de Foix et de Béarn, &amp;c.</i>, p. 506.

     3  Lescar having ceased to be a bishopric since 1790, its
     church, which still exists, no longer ranks as a cathedral.
</pre>
    <p>
      It was in this quaint old cathedral church, dating, so archaeologists
      assert, from the eleventh century, that Margaret&rsquo;s remains were interred
      with all due pomp and ceremony. The Duchess of Estouteville headed the
      procession, followed by the Duke of Montpensier, the Duke of Nevers, the
      Duke of Aumale, the Duke of Etampes, the Marquis of Maine, and M. de
      Rohan. Then came the <i>grands deuils</i> or chief mourners, led by the
      Duke of Vendôme, and three lords carrying the crown, sceptre, and hand of
      justice. The Viscount of Lavedan officiated as grand master of the
      ceremonies, and special seats were assigned to the States of Navarre,
      Foix, Beam, and Bigorre, and to the chancellor, counsellors, and barons of
      the country; whilst on a platform surrounded by lighted tapers there was
      displayed an effigy of the Queen robed in black.(1) After the ceremony a
      banquet was served in accordance with Bearnese custom, the chief mourners
      being invited to the Duke of Vendôme&rsquo;s table, whilst the others were
      served in different rooms.(2)

      A few years later&mdash;in June 1555&mdash;the remains of King Henry,
      Margaret&rsquo;s husband, were in turn brought to Lescar for burial. The tombs
      of husband and wife, however, have alike vanished, having been swept away
      during the religious wars, when Lescar was repeatedly stormed and sacked,
      when Huguenot and Catholic, in turn triumphant, vented their religious
      frenzy upon the graves of their former sovereigns; and to-day the only
      tombs to be found in the old cathedral are those of personages interred
      there since the middle of the seventeenth century.

    <h2>
      ON THE HEPTAMERON,
    </h2>
    <p>
      WITH SOME NOTICE OF PRECEDENT COLLECTIONS OF TALES IN FRANCE, OF THE
      AUTHOR, AND OF HER OTHER WORKS.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is probable that every one who has had much to do with the study of
      literature has conceived certain preferences for books which he knows not
      to belong absolutely to the first order, but which he thinks to have been
      unjustly depreciated by the general judgment, and which appeal to his own
      tastes or sympathies with particular strength. One of such books in my own
      case is <i>THE HEPTAMERON</i> of Margaret of Navarre. I have read it again
      and again, sometimes at short intervals, sometimes at longer, during the
      lapse of some five-and-twenty years since I first met with it. But the
      place which it holds in my critical judgment and in my private affections
      has hardly altered at all since the first reading. I like it as a reader
      perhaps rather more than I esteem it as a critic; but even as a critic,
      and allowing fully for the personal equation, I think that it deserves a
      far higher place than is generally accorded to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three mistakes, as it seems to me, pervade most of the estimates, critical
      or uncritical, of the <i>Heptameron</i>, the two first of old date, the
      third of recent origin. The first is that it is a comparatively feeble
      imitation of a great original, and that any one who knows Boccaccio need
      hardly trouble himself to know Margaret of Navarre. The second is that it
      is a loose if not obscene book, disgraceful for a lady to have written (or
      at least mothered), and not very creditable for any one to read. The third
      is that it is interesting as the gossip of a certain class of modern
      newspapers is interesting, because it tells scandal about distinguished
      personages, and has for its interlocutors other distinguished personages,
      who can be identified without much difficulty, and the identification of
      whom adds zest to the reading. All these three seem to me to be mistakes
      of fact and of judgment. In the first place, the <i>Heptameron</i> borrows
      from its original literally nothing but plan. Its stories are quite
      independent; the similarity of name is only a bookseller&rsquo;s invention,
      though a rather happy one; and the personal setting, which is in Boccaccio
      a mere framework, has here considerable substance and interest. In the
      second place, the accusation of looseness is wildly exaggerated. There is
      one very coarse but not in the least immoral story in the <i>Heptameron</i>;
      there are several broad jests on the obnoxious cloister and its vices,
      there are many tales which are not intended <i>virginibus puerisque</i>,
      and there is a pervading flavour of that half-French, half-Italian
      courtship of married women which was at the time usual everywhere out of
      England. The manners are not our manners, and what may be called the moral
      tone is distinguished by a singular cast, of which more presently. But if
      not entirely a book for boys and girls, the <i>Heptameron</i> is certainly
      not one which Southey need have excepted from his admirable answer in the
      character of author of &ldquo;The Doctor,&rdquo; to the person who wondered whether he
      (Southey) could have daughters, and if so, whether they liked reading. &ldquo;He
      has daughters: they love reading: and he is not the man I take him for if
      they are not &lsquo;allowed to open&rsquo; any book in his library.&rdquo; The last error,
      if not so entirely inconsistent with intelligent reading of the book as
      the first and second, is scarcely less strange to me. For, in the first
      place, the identification of the personages in the framework of the <i>Heptameron</i>
      depends upon the merest and, as it seems to me, the idlest conjecture;
      and, in the second, the interest of the actual tittle-tattle, whether it
      could be fathered on A or B or not, is the least part of the interest of
      the book. Indeed, the stories altogether are, as I think, far less
      interesting than the framework.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us see, therefore, if we cannot treat the <i>Heptameron</i> in a
      somewhat different fashion from that in which any previous critic, even
      Sainte-Beuve, has treated it. The divisions of such treatment are not very
      far to seek. In the first place, let us give some account of the works of
      the same class which preceded and perhaps patterned it. In the second, let
      us give an account of the supposed author, of her other works, and of the
      probable character of her connection with this one. In the third, without
      attempting dry argument, let us give some sketch of the vital part, which
      we have called the framework, and some general characteristics of the
      stories. And, in the fourth and last, let us endeavour to disengage that
      peculiar tone, flavour, note, or whatever word may be preferred, which, as
      it seems to me at least, at once distinguishes the <i>Heptameron</i> from
      other books of the kind, and renders it peculiarly attractive to those
      whose temperament and taste predisposes them to be attracted. For there is
      a great deal of pre-established harmony in literature and literary tastes;
      and I have a kind of idea that every man has his library marked out for
      him when he comes into the world, and has then only got to get the books
      and read them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret herself refers openly enough to the example of the <i>Decameron</i>,
      which had been translated by her own secretary, Anthony le Maçon, a member
      of her literary coterie, and not improbably connected with the writing or
      redacting of the <i>Heptameron</i> itself. Nor were later Italian
      tale-tellers likely to be without influence at a time when French was
      being &ldquo;Italianated&rdquo; in every possible way, to the great disgust of some
      Frenchmen. But the Italian ancestors or patterns need not be dealt with
      here, and can be discovered with ease and pleasure by any one who wishes
      in the drier pages of Dunlop, or in the more flowery and starry pages of
      Mr. Symonds&rsquo; &ldquo;History of the Renaissance in Italy.&rdquo; The next few pages
      will deal only with the French tale-tellers, whose productions before
      Margaret&rsquo;s days were, if not very numerous, far from uninteresting, and
      whose influence on the slight difference of <i>genre</i> which
      distinguishes the tales before us from Italian tales was by no means
      slight.
    </p>
    <p>
      In France, as everywhere else, prose fiction, like prose of all kinds, was
      considerably later in production than verse, and short tales of the kind
      before us were especially postponed by the number, excellence, and
      popularity of the verse <i>fabliaux</i>. Of these, large numbers have come
      down to us, and they exactly correspond in verse to the tales of the <i>Decameron</i>
      and the <i>Heptameron</i> in prose, except that the satirical motive is
      even more strongly marked, and that touches of romantic sentiment are
      rarer. This element of romance, however, appears abundantly in the long
      prose versions of the Arthurian and other legends, and we have a certain
      number of short prose stories of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries,
      of which the most famous is that of <i>Aucassin et Nicolette</i>. These
      latter, however, are rather short romances than distinct prose tales of
      our kind. Of that kind the first famous book in French, and the only
      famous book, besides the one before us, is the <i>Cent Nouvelles Nouvelles</i>.
      The authorship of this book is very uncertain. It purports to be a
      collection of stories told by different persons of the society of Louis
      XI., when he was but Dauphin, and was in exile in Flanders under the
      protection of the Duke of Burgundy. But it has of late years been very
      generally assigned (though on rather slender grounds of probability, and
      none of positive evidence), to Anthony de la Salle, the best French prose
      writer of the fifteenth century, except Comines, and one on whom, with an
      odd unanimity, conjectural criticism has bestowed, besides his
      acknowledged romance of late chivalrous society, <i>Petit Jehan de Saintré</i>
      (a work which itself has some affinities with the class of story before
      us), not only the <i>Cent Nouvelles Nouvelles</i>, but the famous
      satirical treatise of the <i>Quinze Joyes du Mariage</i>, and the still
      more famous farce of <i>Pathelin</i>. Some of the <i>Nouvelles</i>,
      moreover, have been putatively fathered on Louis XI. himself, in which
      case the royal house of France would boast of two distinguished
      taletellers instead of one. However this may be, they all display the
      somewhat hard and grim but keen and practical humour which seems to have
      distinguished that prince, which was a characteristic of French thought
      and temper at the time, and which perhaps arose with the misfortunes and
      hardships of the Hundred Years&rsquo; War. The stories are decidedly amusing,
      with a considerably greater, though also a much ruder, <i>vis comica</i>
      than that of the <i>Heptameron</i>; and they are told in a style unadorned
      indeed, and somewhat dry, lacking the simplicity of the older French, and
      not yet attaining to the graces of the newer, but forcible, distinct, and
      sculpturesque, if not picturesque. A great license of subject and
      language, and an enjoyment of practical jokes of the roughest, not to say
      the most cruel character, prevail throughout, and there is hardly a touch
      of anything like romance; the tales alternating between jests as broad as
      those of the Reeve&rsquo;s and Miller&rsquo;s tales in Chaucer (themselves exactly
      corresponding to verse <i>fabliaux</i>, of which the <i>Cent Nouvelles</i>
      are exact prose counterparts, and perhaps prose versions), and examples of
      what has been called &ldquo;the humour of the stick,&rdquo; which sometimes trenches
      hard upon the humour of the gallows and the torture-chamber. These
      characteristics have made the <i>Cent Nouvelles Nouvelles</i> no great
      favourites of late, but their unpopularity is somewhat undeserved. For all
      their coarseness, there is much genuine comedy in them, and if the
      prettiness of romantic and literary dressing-up is absent from them, so
      likewise is the insincerity thereof. They make one of the most
      considerable prose books of what may be called middle French literature,
      and they had much influence on the books that followed, especially on this
      of Margaret&rsquo;s. Indeed, one of the few examples to be found between the
      two, the <i>Grand Paragon de Nouvelles Nouvelles</i> of Nicolas de Troyes
      (1535), obviously takes them for model. But Nicolas was a dull dog, and
      neither profited by his model nor gave any one else opportunity to profit
      by himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rabelais, the first book of whose <i>Pantagruel</i> anticipated the <i>Paragon</i>
      by three years, while the <i>Gargantua</i> coincided with it, was a great
      authority at the Court of Margaret&rsquo;s brother Francis, dedicated one of the
      books (the third) of <i>Pantagruel</i> to her, before her death, in
      high-flown language, as <i>esprit abstrait, ravy et ecstatic</i>, and must
      certainly have been familiar reading of hers, and of all the ladies and
      gentlemen, literary and fashionable, of her Court. But there is little
      resemblance to be found in his style and hers. The short stories which
      Master Francis scatters about his longer work are, indeed, models of
      narration, but his whole tone of thought and manner of treatment are
      altogether alien from those of the &ldquo;ravished spirit&rdquo; whom he praises. His
      deliberate coarseness is not more different from her deliberate delicacy
      than his intensely practical spirit from her high-flown romanticism (which
      makes one think of, and may have suggested, the Court of La Quinte), and
      her mixture of devout and amatory quodlibetation from his cynical
      criticism and all-dissolving irony. But there was a contemporary of
      Rabelais who forms a kind of link between him and Margaret, whose work in
      part is very like the <i>Heptameron</i>, and who has been thought to have
      had more than a hand in it. This was Bonaventure Despériers, a man whose
      history is as obscure as his works are interesting. Born in or about the
      year 1500, he committed suicide in 1544, either during a fit of insanity,
      or, as has been thought more likely, in order to escape the danger of the
      persecution which, in the last years of the reign of Francis, threatened
      the unorthodox, and which Margaret, who had more than once warded it off
      from them, was then powerless to avert. Despériers, to speak truth, was in
      far more danger of the stake than most of his friends. The infidelity of
      Rabelais is a matter of inference only, and some critics (among whom the
      present writer ranks himself) see in his daring ridicule of existing
      abuses nothing inconsistent with a perfectly sound, if liberally
      conditioned, orthodoxy. Despériers, like Rabelais, was a Lucianist, but
      his modernising of Lucian (the remarkable book called <i>Cymbalum Mundï</i>),
      though pretending to deal with ancient mythology, has an almost
      unmistakable reference to revealed religion. It is not, however, by this
      work or by this side of his character at all that Despériers is brought
      into connection with the work of Margaret, who, if learned and liberal,
      and sometimes tending to the new ideas in religion, was always devout and
      always orthodox in fundamentals. Besides the <i>Cymbalum Mundi</i>, he has
      left a curious book, not published, like the <i>Heptameron</i> itself,
      till long after his own death, and entitled <i>Nouvelles Récréations et
      Joyeux Devis</i>. The tales of which it consists are for the most part
      very short, some being rather sketches or outlines of tales than actually
      worked-out stories, so that, although there are no less than a hundred and
      twenty-nine of them, the whole book is probably not half the bulk of the
      <i>Heptameron</i> itself. But they are extremely well written, and the
      specially interesting thing about them is, that in them there appears, and
      appears for the first time (unless we take the <i>Heptameron</i> itself as
      earlier, which is contrary to all probability), the singular and, at any
      rate to some persons, very attractive mixture of sentiment and satire, of
      learning and a love of refined society, of joint devotion to heavenly and
      earthly love, of voluptuous enjoyment of the present, blended and shadowed
      with a sense of the night that cometh, which delights us in the prose of
      the <i>Heptameron</i>, and in the verse not only of all the Pléiade poets
      in France, but of Spenser, Donne, and some of their followers in England.
      The scale of the stories, which are sometimes mere anecdotes, is so small,
      the room for miscellaneous discourse in them is so scanty, and the absence
      of any connecting Alinks, such as those of Margaret&rsquo;s own plan, checks the
      expression of personal feeling so much, that it is only occasionally that
      this cast of thought can be perceived. But it is there, and its presence
      is an important element in determining the question of the exact
      authorship of the <i>Heptameron</i> itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It can hardly be said that, except translations from the Italian (of which
      the close intercourse between France and Italy in the days of the later
      Valois produced many), Margaret had many other examples before her. For
      such a book as the <i>Propos Rustiques</i> of Noël du Fail, though
      published before her death, is not likely to have exercised any influence
      over her; and most other books of the kind are later than her own. One
      such (for, despite its <i>bizarre</i> title and its distinct intention of
      attacking the Roman Church, Henry Estienne&rsquo;s <i>Apologie pour Hérodote</i>
      is really a collection of stories) deserves mention, not because of its
      influence upon the Queen of Navarre, but because of the Queen of Navarre&rsquo;s
      influence upon it. Estienne is constantly quoting the <i>Heptameron</i>,
      and though to a certain extent the inveteracy with which the friars are
      attacked here must have given the book a special attraction for him, two
      things may be gathered from his quotations and attributions. The first is
      that the book was a very popular one; the second, that there was no doubt
      among well-informed persons, of whom and in whose company Estienne most
      certainly was, that the <i>Heptameron</i> was in more than name the work
      of its supposed author.
    </p>
    <p>
      From what went before it Margaret could, and could not, borrow certain
      well-defined things. Models both Italian and French gave her the scheme of
      including a large number of short and curtly, but not skimpingly, told
      stories in one general framework, and of subdividing them into groups
      dealing more or less with the same subject or class of subject. She had
      also in her predecessors the example of drawing largely on that perennial
      and somewhat facile source of laughter&mdash;the putting together of
      incidents and phrases which even by those who laugh at them are regarded
      as indecorous. But of this expedient she availed herself rather less than
      any of her forerunners. She had further the example of a generally
      satirical intent; but here, too, she was not content merely to follow, and
      her satire is, for the most part, limited to the corruptions and abuses of
      the monastic orders. It can hardly be said that any of the other stock
      subjects, lawyers, doctors, citizens, even husbands (for she is less
      satirical on marriage than encomiastic of love), are dealt with much by
      her. She found also in some, but chiefly in older books of the Chartier
      and still earlier traditions, and rather in Italian than in French, a
      certain strain of romance proper and of adventure; but of this also she
      availed herself but rarely. What she did not find in any example (unless,
      and then but partially, in the example of her own servant, Bonaventure
      Des-périers) was first the interweaving of a great deal not merely of
      formal religious exercise, but of positive religious devotion in her work;
      and secondly, the infusing into it of the peculiar Renaissance contrast,
      so often to be noticed, of love and death, passion and piety, voluptuous
      enjoyment and sombre anticipation.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it is now time to say a little more about the personality and work of
      this lady, whose name all this time we have been using freely, and who was
      indeed a very notable person quite independently of her literary work. Nor
      was she in literature by any means an unnotable one, quite independently
      of the collection of unfinished stories, which, after receiving at its
      first posthumous publication the not particularly appropriate title of <i>Les
      Amants Fortunés</i>, was more fortunately re-named, albeit by something of
      a bull (for there is the beginning of an eighth day as well as the full
      complement of the seven), the <i>Heptameron</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few ladies have been known in history by more and more confusing titles
      than the author of the <i>Heptameron</i>, the confusion arising partly
      from the fact that she had a niece and a great-niece of the same charming
      Christian name as herself. The second Margaret de Valois (the most
      appropriate name of all three, as it was theirs by family right) was the
      daughter of Francis I., the patroness of Ronsard, and, somewhat late in
      life, the wife of the Duke of Savoy&mdash;a marriage which, as the bride
      carried with her a dowry of territory, was not popular, and brought some
      coarse jests on her. Not much is said of her personal appearance after her
      infancy; but she inherited her aunt&rsquo;s literary tastes, if not her literary
      powers, and gave Ronsard powerful support in his early days. The third was
      the daughter of Henry II., the &ldquo;Grosse Margot&rdquo; of her brother, Henry III.,
      the &ldquo;Reine Margot&rdquo; of Dumas&rsquo; novel, the idol of Brantôme, the first wife
      of Henry IV., the beloved of Guise, La Mole, and a long succession of
      gallants, the rival of her sister-in-law Mary Stuart, not in misfortunes,
      but as the most beautiful, gracious, learned, accomplished, and amiable of
      the ladies of her time. This Margaret would have been an almost perfect
      heroine of romance (for she had every good quality except chastity), if
      she had not unluckily lived rather too long.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her great-aunt, our present subject, was not the equal of her great-niece
      in beauty, her portraits being rendered uncomely by a portentously long
      nose, longer even than Mrs. Siddons&rsquo;s, and by a very curious expression of
      the eyes, going near to slyness. But the face is one which can be imagined
      as much more beautiful than it seems in the not very attractive
      portraiture of the time, and her actual attractions are attested by her
      contemporaries with something more than the homage-to-order which literary
      men have never failed to pay to ladies who are patronesses of letters.
      Besides Margaret of Valois, she is known as Margaret of Angoulême, from
      her place of birth and her father&rsquo;s title; Margaret of Alençon, from the
      fief of her first husband; Margaret of Navarre, of which country, like her
      grand-niece, she was queen, by her second marriage with Henry d&rsquo;Albret;
      and even Margaret of Orleans, as belonging to the Orleans branch of the
      royal house. She was not, like her nieces, Margaret of France, as her
      father never reigned, and Brantôme properly denies her the title, but
      others sometimes give it. When it is necessary to call her anything
      besides the simple &ldquo;Margaret,&rdquo; Angoulême is at once the most appropriate
      and the most distinctive designation. She was born on the 11th or 12th of
      April 1492, her father being Charles, Count of Angoulême, and her mother
      Louise of Savoy. She was their eldest child, and two years older than her
      brother, the future King Francis. According to, and even in excess of, the
      custom of the age, she received a very learned education, acquiring not
      merely the three tongues, French, Italian, and Spanish, which were all in
      common use at the French Court during her time, but Latin, and even a
      little Greek and a little Hebrew. She lived in the provinces both before
      and after her marriage, in 1509, to her relation, Charles, Duke of
      Alençon, who was older than herself by three years, and though a fair
      soldier and an inoffensive person, was apparently of little talents and
      not particularly amiable. The accession of her brother to the throne
      opened a much more brilliant career to her. She and her mother jointly
      exercised great influence over Francis; and the Duchess of Alençon, to
      whom her brother shortly afterwards gave Berry, was for many years one of
      the most influential persons in the kingdom, using her influence almost
      invariably for good. Her husband died soon after Pavia, and in the same
      year (September 1525) she undertook a journey to Spain on behalf of her
      captive brother. This journey, with some expressions in her letters and in
      Brantôme, has been wrested by some critics in order to prove that her
      affection for Francis was warmer than it ought to have been&mdash;an
      imputation wanton in both senses of the word.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was sought in marriage by or offered in marriage to divers
      distinguished persons during her widowhood, and this was also the time of
      her principal diplomatic exercise, an office for which&mdash;odd as it now
      seems for a woman&mdash;she had, like her mother, like her niece Catherine
      of Medicis, like her namesake Margaret of Parma, and like other ladies of
      the age, a very considerable aptitude and reputation. When she at last
      married, the match was not a brilliant one, though it proved, contrary to
      immediate probability, to be the source of the last and the most glorious
      branch of the royal dynasty of France. The bridegroom bore indeed the
      title of King of Navarre and possessed Beam, but his kingdom had long been
      in Spanish hands, and but for his wife&rsquo;s dowry of Alençon and appanage of
      Berry (to which Francis had added Armagnac and a large pension) he would
      have been but a lackland. Furthermore, he was eleven years younger than
      herself, and it is at least insinuated that the affection, if there was
      any, was chiefly on her side. At any rate, this earlier Henry of Navarre
      seems to have had not a few of the characteristics of his grandson,
      together with a violence and brutality which, to do the <i>Vert Galant</i>
      justice, formed no part of his character. The only son of the marriage
      died young, and a girl, Jane d&rsquo;Albret, mother of the great Bourbon race of
      the next two centuries, was taken away from her parents by &ldquo;reasons of
      state&rdquo; for a time. The domestic life of Margaret, however, concerns us but
      little, except in one way. Her husband disliked administration, and she
      was the principal ruler in their rather extensive estates or dominions.
      Moreover, she was able at her quasi-Court to extend the literary coteries
      which she had already begun to form at Paris. The patronage to men of
      letters for which her brother is famous was certainly more due to her than
      to himself; and to her also was due the partial toleration of religious
      liberty which for a time distinguished his reign. It was not till her
      influence was weakened that intolerance prevailed, and she was able even
      then for a time to save Marot and other distinguished persons from
      persecution. It is rather a moot-point how far she inclined to the
      Reformed doctrines, properly so called. Her letters, her serious and
      poetical work, and even the <i>Heptameron</i> itself, show a fervently
      pietistic spirit, and occasionally seem to testify to a distinct
      inclination towards Protestantism, which is also positively attested by
      Brantôme and others; but this Protestantism must have been, so far as it
      was consistent and definite at all, the Protestantism of Erasmus rather
      than of Luther, of Rabelais rather than of Calvin. She had a very strong
      objection to the coarseness, the vices, the idleness, the brutish
      ignorance of the cloister; she had aspirations after a more spiritual form
      of religion than the ordinary Catholicism of her day provided, and as a
      strong politician she may have had something of that Gallicanism which has
      always been well marked in some of the best Frenchmen, and which at one
      time nearly prevailed with her great-great-grandson, Louis XIV. But there
      is no doubt that, as her brother said to the fanatical Montmorency, she
      would always have been and always was of his religion, the religion of the
      State. The side of the Reformation which must have most appealed to her
      was neither its austere morals, nor its bare ritual, nor its doctrines,
      properly so called, but its spiritual pietism and its connection with
      profane learning and letters; for of literature Margaret was an ardent
      devotee and a constant practitioner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her best days were done by the time of her second marriage. After the
      King&rsquo;s return from Spain persecution broke out, and Margaret&rsquo;s influence
      became more and more weak to stop it. As early as 1533 her own <i>Miroir
      de l&rsquo;Ame Pécheresse</i>, then in a second edition, provoked the fanaticism
      of the Sorbonne, and the King had to interfere in person to protect his
      sister&rsquo;s work and herself from gross insult. The Medici marriage increased
      the persecuting tendency, and for a time there was even an attempt to
      suppress printing, and with it all that new literature which was the
      Queen&rsquo;s delight. She was herself in some danger, but Francis had not sunk
      so low as to permit any actual attack to be made on her. Yet all the last
      years of her life were unhappy, though she continued to keep Court at
      Nérac in Pau, to accompany her brother in his progresses, and, as we know
      from documents, to play Lady Bountiful over a wide area of France. Her
      husband appears to have been rather at variance with her; and her
      daughter, who married first, and in name only, the Duke of Cleves in 1540,
      and later (1548) Anthony de Bourbon, was also not on cordial terms with
      her mother. By the date of this second marriage Francis was dead, and
      though he had for many years been anything but wholly kind, Margaret&rsquo;s
      good days were now in truth done. Her nephew Henry left her in possession
      of her revenues, but does not seem to have been very affectionately
      disposed towards her; and even had she been inclined to attempt any
      recovery of influence, his wife and his mistress, Catherine de Medici and
      Diana of Poitiers, two women as different from Margaret as they were from
      one another, would certainly have prevented her from obtaining it. As a
      matter of fact, however, she had long been in ill-health, and her
      brother&rsquo;s death seems to have dealt her the final stroke. She survived it
      two years, even as she had been born two years before him, and died on the
      21 st December 1549, at the Castle of Odos, near Tarbes, having lived in
      almost complete retirement for a considerable time. Her husband is said to
      have regretted her dead more than he loved her living, and her literary
      admirers, such of them as death and exile had spared, were not ungrateful.
      <i>Tombeaux</i>, or collections of funeral verses, were not lacking, the
      first being in Latin, and, oddly enough, nominally by three English
      sisters, Anne, Margaret, and Jane Seymour, nieces of Henry VIII.&lsquo;s queen
      and Edward VI.&lsquo;s mother, with learned persons like Dorât, Sainte-Marthe,
      and Baïf. This was re-issued in French and in a fuller form later.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some reference has been made to an atrocious slur cast without a shred of
      evidence on her moral character. There is as little foundation for more
      general though milder charges of laxity. It is admitted that she had
      little love for her first husband, and it seems to be probable that her
      second had not much love for her. She was certainly addressed in gallant
      strains by men of letters, the most audacious being Clement Marot; but the
      almost universal reference of the well-known and delightful lines
      beginning&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Un doux nenny avec un doux sourire,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      to her method of dealing not merely with this lover but with others,
      argues a general confidence in her being a virtuous coquette, if somewhat
      coquettishly virtuous. It may be added that the whole tone of the <i>Heptameron</i>
      points to a very similar conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her literary work was very considerable, and it falls under three
      divisions: letters, the book before us, and the very curious and
      interesting collection of poems known by the charming if fantastic title
      of <i>Les Marguerites de la Marguerite des Princesses</i>, a play on the
      meanings, daisy, pearl, and Margaret, which had been popular in the
      artificial school of French poetry since the end of the thirteenth century
      in a vast number of forms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The letters are naturally of the very first importance for determining the
      character of Margaret&rsquo;s life as a woman of business, a diplomatist, and so
      forth. They show her to us in all these capacities, and also in that of an
      enlightened and always ready patroness of letters and of men of letters.
      Further, they are of value, though their value is somewhat affected by a
      reservation to be made immediately, as to her mental and moral
      characteristics. But they are not of literary interest at all equal to
      that of either of the other divisions. They are, if not spoilt, still not
      improved, by the fact that the art of easy letter-writing, in which
      Frenchwomen of the next century were to show themselves such proficients,
      had not yet been developed, and that most of them are couched in a heavy,
      laborious, semiofficial style, which smells, as far as mere style goes, of
      the cumbrous refinements of the <i>rhétoriqueurs</i>, in whose flourishing
      time Margaret herself grew up, and which conceals the writer&rsquo;s sentiments
      under elaborate forms of ceremonial courtesy. Something at least of the
      groundless scandal before referred to is derived in all probability, if
      not in all certainty, from the lavish use of hyperbole in addressing her
      brother; and generally speaking, the rebuke of the Queen to Polonius,
      &ldquo;More matter with less art,&rdquo; is applicable to the whole correspondence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something of the same evil influence is shown in the Marguerites. It must
      be remembered that the writer died before the Pléiade movement had been
      fully started, and that she was older by five years than Marot, the only
      one of her own contemporaries and her own literary circle who attained to
      a poetic style easier, freer, and more genuine than the cumbrous rhetoric,
      partly derived from the allegorising style of the <i>Roman de la Rose</i>
      and its followers, partly influenced by corrupt following of the
      re-discovered and scarcely yet understood classics, partly alloyed with
      Flemish and German and Spanish stiffness, of which Chastellain, Crétin,
      and the rest have been the frequently quoted and the rarely read exponents
      to students of French literature. The contents of the <i>Marguerites</i>,
      to take the order of the beautiful edition of M. Félix Frank, are as
      follows: Volume I. contains first a long and singular religious poem
      entitled <i>Le Miroir de l&rsquo;Ame Pécheresse</i>, in rhymed decasyllables, in
      which pretty literal paraphrases of a large number of passages of
      Scripture are strung together with a certain amount of pious comment and
      reflection. This is followed (after a shorter piece on the contest in the
      human soul between the laws of the spirit and of the flesh) by another
      poem of about the same length as the <i>Miroir</i>, and of no very
      different character, entitled <i>Oraison de L&rsquo;Ame Fidèle à son Seigneur
      Dieu</i>, and a shorter <i>Oraison à Notre Seigneur Jésus Christ</i>
      completes the volume. The second volume yields four so-called &ldquo;comedies,&rdquo;
       but really mysteries on the old mediæval model, only distinguishable from
      their forerunners by slightly more modern language and a more scriptural
      tone. The subjects are the Nativity, the Adoration of the Three Kings, the
      Massacre of the Innocents, and the Flight into Egypt. The third volume
      contains a third poem in the style of the <i>Miroir</i>, but much
      superior, <i>Le Triomphe de l&rsquo;Agneau</i>, a considerable body of spiritual
      songs, a miscellaneous poem or two, and some epistles, chiefly addressed
      to Francis. These last begin the smaller and secular division of the <i>Marguerites</i>,
      which is completed in the fourth volume by <i>Les Quatre Dames et les
      Quatre Gentilhommes</i>, composed of long monologues after the fashion of
      the Froissart-Chartier school, by a &ldquo;<i>comédie profane</i>,&rdquo; a farce
      entitled <i>Trop, Prou [much], Peu, Moins</i>; a long love poem, again in
      the Chartier style, entitled <i>La Coche</i>, and some minor pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Opinion as to these poems has varied somewhat, but their merit has never
      been put very high, nor, to tell the truth, could it be put high by any
      one who speaks critically. In the first place, they are written for the
      most part on very bad models, both in general plan and in particular style
      and expression. The plan is, as has been said, taken from the long-winded
      allegorical erotic poetry of the very late thirteenth, the fourteenth, and
      the fifteenth centuries&mdash;poetry which is now among the most difficult
      to read in any literature. The groundwork or canvas being transferred from
      love to religion, it gains a little in freshness and directness of
      purpose, but hardly in general readableness. Thus, for instance, two whole
      pages of the <i>Miroir</i>, or some forty or fifty lines, are taken up
      with endless playings on the words <i>mort</i> and <i>vie</i> and their
      derivatives, such as <i>mortifiez, and mort fiez, mort vivifiée and vie
      mourante</i>. The sacred comedies or mysteries have the tediousness and
      lack of action of the older pieces of the same kind without their <i>naïveté</i>;
      and pretty much the same may be said of the profane comedy (which is a
      kind of morality), and of the farce. Of <i>La Coche</i>, what has been
      said of the long sacred poems may be said, except that here we go back to
      the actual subject of the models, not on the whole with advantage: while
      in the minor pieces the same word plays and frigid conceits are
      observable.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if this somewhat severe judgment must be passed on the poems as
      wholes, and from a certain point of view, it may be considerably softened
      when they are considered more in detail. In not a few passages of the
      religious poems Margaret has reached (and as she had no examples before
      her except Marot&rsquo;s psalms, which were themselves later than at least some
      of her work, may be said to have anticipated) that grave and solemn
      harmony of the French Huguenots of the sixteenth century, which in Du
      Bartas, in Agrippa d&rsquo;Aubigné, and in passages of the tragedian
      Montchrestien, strikes notes hardly touched elsewhere in French
      literature. The <i>Triomphe de l&rsquo;Agneau</i> displays her at her best in
      this respect, and not unfrequently comes not too far off from the
      apocalyptic resonance of d&rsquo;Aubigné himself. Again, the <i>Bergerie</i>
      included in the Nativity comedy or mystery, though something of a Dresden
      <i>Bergerie</i> (to use a later image), is graceful and elegant enough in
      all conscience. But it is on the minor poems, especially the Epistles and
      the <i>Chansons Spirituelles</i>, that the defenders of Margaret&rsquo;s claim
      to be a poet rest most strongly. In the former her love, not merely for
      her brother, but for her husband, appears unmistakably, and suggests
      graceful thoughts. In the latter the force and fire which occasionally
      break through the stiff wrappings of the longer poems appear with less
      difficulty and in fuller measure.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is, however, undoubtedly curious, and not to be explained merely by the
      difference of subject, that the styles of the letters and of the poems,
      agreeing well enough between themselves, differ most remarkably from that
      of the <i>Heptameron</i>. The two former are decidedly open to the charges
      of pedantry, artificiality, heaviness. There is a great surplusage of
      words and a seeming inability to get to the point. The <i>Heptameron</i>
      if not equal in narrative vigour and lightness to Boccaccio before and La
      Fontaine afterwards, is not in the least exposed to the charge of
      clumsiness of any kind, employs a simple, natural, and sufficiently
      picturesque vocabulary, avoids all verbiage and roundabout writing, and
      both in the narratives and in the connecting conversation displays a very
      considerable advance upon nearly all the writers of the time, except
      Rabelais, Marot, and Despériers, in easy command of the vernacular. It is,
      therefore, not wonderful that there has, at different times (rather less
      of late years, but that is probably an accident), been a disposition if
      not to take away from Margaret all the credit of the book, at any rate to
      give a share of it to others. In so far as this share is attempted to be
      bestowed on ladies and gentlemen of her Court or family there is very
      little evidence for it; but in so far as the pen may be thought to have
      been sometimes held for her by the distinguished men of letters just
      referred to (there is no reason why Master Francis himself should not have
      sometimes guided it), and by others only less distinguished, there is
      considerable internal reason to favour the idea. At all times and in all
      places&mdash;in France perhaps more than anywhere else&mdash;kings and
      queens, lords and ladies, have found no difficulty (we need not use the
      harsh Voltairian-Carlylian phrase, and say in getting their literary work
      &ldquo;buckwashed,&rdquo; but) in getting it pointed and seasoned, trimmed and
      ornamented by professional men of letters. The form of the <i>Heptameron</i>
      lends itself more than any other to such assistance; and while I should
      imagine that the setting, with its strong colour, both of religiosity and
      amorousness, is almost wholly Margaret&rsquo;s work, I should also think it so
      likely as to be nearly certain that in some at least of the tales the
      hands of the authors of the <i>Cymbalum Mundi</i> and the <i>Adolescence
      Clémentine</i>, of Le Maçon and Brodeau, may have worked at the devising,
      very likely re-shaped and adjusted by the Queen herself, of the actual
      stories as we have them now.
    </p>
    <p>
      The book, as we have it, consists of seven complete days of ten novels
      each, and of an eighth containing two novels only. The fictitious scheme
      of the setting is somewhat less lugubrious than that of the <i>Decameron</i>,
      but still not without an element of tragedy. On the first of September,
      &ldquo;when the hot springs of the Pyrenees begin to enter upon their virtue,&rdquo; a
      company of persons of quality assembled at Cauterets, we are told, and
      abode there three weeks with much profit. But when they tried to return,
      rain set in with such severity that they thought the Deluge had come
      again, and they found their roads, especially that to the French side,
      almost entirely barred by the Gave de Béarn and other rivers. So they
      scattered in different directions, most of them taking the Spanish side,
      either along the mountains and across to Roussillon or straight to
      Barcelona, and thence home by sea. But a certain widow, named Oisille,
      made her way with much loss of men and horses to the Abbey of Notre Dame
      de Serrance. Here she was joined by divers gentlemen and ladies, who had
      had even worse experiences of travel than herself, with bears and
      brigands, and other evil things, so that one of them, Longarine, had lost
      her husband, murdered in an affray in one of the cut-throat inns always
      dear to romance. Besides this disconsolate person and Oisille, the company
      consisted of a married pair, Hircan and Parlamente; two young cavaliers,
      Dagoucin and Saffredent; two young ladies, Nomerfide and Ennasuite;
      Simontault, a cavalier-servant of Parlamente; and Geburon, a knight older
      and discreeter than the rest of the company except Oisille.(1)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1 These names have been accommodated to M. Le Roux de
     Lincy&rsquo;s orthography, from MS. No. 1512; but for myself I
     prefer the spellings, especially &ldquo;Emarsuitte,&rdquo; more usual in
     the printed editions.&mdash;G. S.
</pre>
    <p>
      These form the party, and it is to be noted that idle and contradictory as
      all the attempts made to identify them have been (for instance, the most
      confident interpreters hesitate between Oisille and Parlamente, an aged
      widow and a youthful wife, for Margaret herself), it is not to be denied
      that the various parts are kept up with much decision and spirit. Of the
      men, indeed, Hircan is the only one who has a very decided character, and
      is represented as fond of his wife, Parlamente, but a decided libertine
      and of a somewhat rough and ruthless general character&mdash;points which
      have made the interpreters sure that he must be Henry d&rsquo;Albret. The
      others, except that Geburon is, as had been said, older than his
      companions, and that Simontault sighs vainly after Parlamente, are merely
      walking gentlemen of the time, accomplished enough, but not individual.
      The women are much more distinct and show a woman&rsquo;s hand. Oisille is, as
      our own seventeenth-century ancestors would have said, ancient and sober,
      very devout, regarded with great respect by the rest of the company, and
      accepted as a kind of mistress both of the revels and of more serious
      matters, but still a woman of the world, and content to make only an
      occasional and mild protest against tolerably free stories and sentiments.
      Parlamente, considerably younger, and though virtuous, not by any means
      ignorant of or wholly averse to the devotion of Simontault, indulging
      occasionally in a kind of mild conjugal sparring with her husband, Hircan,
      but apparently devoted to him, full of religion and romance and refinement
      at once, is a very charming character, resembling Madame de Sévigné as she
      may have been in her unknown or hardly known youth, when husband and
      lovers alike were attracted by the flame of her beauty and charm, only to
      complain that it froze and did not burn. Longarine is discreetly unhappy
      for her dead husband, but appears decidedly consolable; Ennasuite is a
      haughty damsel, disdainful of poor folk, and Nomerfide is a pure madcap, a
      Catherine Seyton of the generation before Catherine herself, the feminine
      Dioneo of the party, and, if a little too free-spoken for prudish modern
      taste, a very delightful girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now when this good company had assembled at Serrance and told each other
      their misadventures, the waters on inquiry seemed to be out more widely
      and more dangerously than before, so that it was impossible to think of
      going farther for the time. They deliberated accordingly how they should
      employ themselves, and, after allowing, on the proposal of Oisille, an
      ample space for sacred exercises, they resolved that every day, after
      dinner and an interval, they should assemble in a meadow on the bank of
      the Gave at midday and tell stories. The device is carried out with such
      success that the monks steal behind the hedges to hear them, and an
      occasional postponement of vespers takes place. Simontault begins, and the
      system of tale-telling goes round on the usual plan of each speaker naming
      him or her who shall follow. It should be observed that no general subject
      is, as in the <i>Decameron</i>, prescribed to the speakers of each day,
      though, as a matter of course, one subject often suggests another of not
      dissimilar kind. Nor is there the Decameronic arrangement of the &ldquo;king.&rdquo;
       Between the stories, and also between the days, there is often a good deal
      of conversation, in which the divers characters, as given above, are
      carried out with a minuteness very different from the chief Italian
      original.
    </p>
    <p>
      From what has been said already, it will be readily perceived that the
      novels, or rather their subjects, are not very easy to class in any
      rationalised order. The great majority, if they do not answer exactly to
      the old title of <i>Les Histoires des Amants Fortunés</i>, are devoted to
      the eternal subject of the tricks played by wives to the disadvantage of
      husbands, by husbands to the disadvantage of wives, and sometimes by
      lovers to the disadvantage of both. &ldquo;Subtilité&rdquo; is a frequent word in the
      titles, and it corresponds to a real thing. Another large division,
      trenching somewhat upon the first, is composed of stories to the discredit
      of the monks (something, though less, is said against the secular clergy),
      and especially of the Cordeliers or Franciscans, an Order who, for their
      coarse immorality and their brutal antipathy to learning, were the special
      black (or rather grey) beasts of the literary reformers of the time. In a
      considerable number there are references to actual personages of the time&mdash;references
      which stand on a very different footing of identification from the puerile
      guessings at the personality of the interlocutors so often referred to.
      Sometimes these references are avowed: &ldquo;Un des muletiers de la Reine de
      Navarre,&rdquo; &ldquo;Le Roi François montre sa générosité,&rdquo; &ldquo;Un Président de
      Grenoble,&rdquo; &ldquo;Une femme d&rsquo;Alençon,&rdquo; and so forth. At other times the
      reference is somewhat more covert, but hardly to be doubted, as in the
      remarkable story of a &ldquo;great Prince&rdquo; (obviously Francis himself) who used
      on his journeyings to and from an assignation of a very illegitimate
      character, to turn into a church and piously pursue his devotions. There
      are a few curious stories in which amatory matters play only a subordinate
      part or none at all, though it must be confessed that this last is a rare
      thing. Some are mere anecdote plays on words (sometimes pretty free, and
      then generally told by Nomer-fide), or quasi-historical, such as that
      already noticed of the generosity of Francis to a traitor, or deal with
      remarkable trials and crimes, or merely miscellaneous matters, the best of
      the last class being the capital &ldquo;Bonne invention pour chasser le lutin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In so large a number of stories with so great a variety of subjects, it
      naturally cannot but be the case that there is a considerable diversity of
      tone. But that peculiarity at which we have glanced more than once, the
      combination of voluptuous passion with passionate regret and a mystical
      devotion, is seldom absent for long together. The general note, indeed, of
      the <i>Heptameron</i> is given by more than one passage in Brantôme&mdash;at
      greatest length by one which Sainte-Beuve has rightly quoted, at the same
      time and also rightly rebuking the sceptical Abbé&rsquo;s determination to see
      in it little more than a piece of <i>précieuse</i> mannerliness (though,
      indeed, the <i>Précieuses</i> were not yet). Yet even Sainte-Beuve has
      scarcely pointed out quite strongly enough how entirely this is the
      keynote of all Margaret&rsquo;s work, and especially of the <i>Heptameron</i>.
      The story therefore may be worth telling again, though it may be found in
      the &ldquo;Cinquième Discours&rdquo; of the <i>Vies des Dames Galantes</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brantôme&rsquo;s brother, not yet a captain in the army, but a student
      travelling in Italy, had in sojourning at Ferrara, when Renée of France
      was Duchess, fallen in love with a certain Mademoiselle de la Roche. For
      love of him she had returned to France, and, visiting his own country of
      Gascony, had attached herself to the Court of Margaret, where she had
      died. And it happened that Bourdeilles, six months afterwards, and having
      forgotten all about his dead love, came to Pau and went to pay his
      respects to the Queen. He met her coming back from vespers, and she
      greeted him graciously, and they talked of this matter and of that. But,
      as they walked together hither and thither, the Queen drew him, without
      cause shown, into the church she had just left, where Mademoiselle de la
      Roche was buried. &ldquo;Cousin,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;do you feel nothing stirring
      beneath you and under your feet?&rdquo; But he said, &ldquo;Nothing, Madame.&rdquo; &ldquo;Think,
      cousin,&rdquo; then said she once again. But he said, &ldquo;Madame, I have thought
      well, but I feel nought; for under me there is but a stone, hard and
      firmly set.&rdquo; &ldquo;Now, do I tell you,&rdquo; said the Queen, leaving him no longer
      at study, &ldquo;that you are above the tomb and the body of Mademoiselle de la
      Roche, who is buried beneath you, and whom you loved so much in her
      lifetime. And since our souls have sense after our death, it cannot be but
      that this faithful one, dead so lately, felt your presence as soon as you
      came near her; and if you have not perceived it, because of the thickness
      of the tomb, doubt not that none the less she felt it. And forasmuch as it
      is a pious work to make memory of the dead, and notably of those whom we
      loved, I pray you give her a <i>pater</i> and an <i>ave</i>, and likewise
      a <i>de profundis</i>, and pour out holy water. So shall you make acquist
      of the name of a right faithful lover and a good Christian.&rdquo; And she left
      him that he might do this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brantôme (though he had an admiration for Margaret, whose lady of honour
      his grandmother had been, and who, according to the Bourdeilles tradition,
      composed her novels in travelling) thought this a pretty fashion of
      converse. &ldquo;Voilà,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;l&rsquo;opinion de cette bonne princesse; laquelle
      la tenait plus par gentillesse et par forme de devis que par créance à mon
      avis.&rdquo; Sainte-Beuve, on the contrary, and with better reason, sees in it
      faith, graciousness, feminine delicacy, and piety at once. No doubt; but
      there is something more than this, and that something more is what we are
      in search of, and what we shall find, now in one way, now in another,
      throughout the book: something whereof the sentiment of Donne&rsquo;s famous
      thoughts on the old lover&rsquo;s ghost, on the blanched bone with its circlet
      of golden tresses, is the best known instance in English. The madcap
      Nomerfide indeed lays it down, that &ldquo;the meditation of death cools the
      heart not a little.&rdquo; But her more experienced companions know better. The
      worse side of this Renaissance peculiarity is told in the last tale, a
      rather ghastly story of monkish corruption; its lighter side appears in
      the story, already referred to, of the &ldquo;Grand Prince&rdquo; and his pious
      devotions on the way to not particularly pious occupation. But touches of
      the more poetical and romantic effects of it are all over the book. It is
      to be found in the story of the gentleman who forsook the world because of
      his beloved&rsquo;s cruelty, whereat she repenting did likewise (&ldquo;he had much
      better have thrown away his cowl and married her,&rdquo; quoth the practical
      Nomerfide); in that of the wife who, to obtain freedom of living with her
      paramour, actually allowed herself to be buried; in that (very
      characteristic of the time, especially for the touch of farce in it) of
      the unlucky person to whom phlebotomy and love together were fatal; and in
      not a few others, while it emerges in casual phrases of the intermediate
      conversations and of the stories themselves, even when it is not to be
      detected in the general character of the subjects.
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus we can pretty well decide what is the most interesting and
      important part of the whole subject. The question, What is the special
      virtue of the <i>Heptameron</i>? I have myself little hesitation in
      answering. There is no book, in prose and of so early a date, which shows
      to me the characteristic of the time as it influenced the two great
      literary nations of Europe so distinctly as this book of Margaret of
      Angoulême. Take it as a book of Court gossip, and it is rather less
      interesting than most books of Court gossip, which is saying much. Take it
      as the performance of a single person, and you are confronted with the
      difficulty that it is quite unlike that other person&rsquo;s more certain works,
      and that it is in all probability a joint affair. Take its separate
      stories, and, with rare exceptions, they are not of the first order of
      interest, or even of the second. But separate the individual purport of
      these stories from the general colour or tone of them; take this general
      colour or tone in connection with the tenor of the intermediate
      conversations, which form so striking a characteristic of the book, and
      something quite different appears. It is that same peculiarity which
      appears in places and persons and things so different as Spenser, as the
      poetry of the Pléiade, as Montaigne, as Raleigh, as Donne, as the group of
      singers known as the Caroline poets. It is a peculiarity which has shown
      itself in different forms at different times, but never in such vigour and
      precision as at this time. It combines a profound and certainly sincere&mdash;almost
      severe&mdash;religiosity with a very vigorous practice of some things
      which the religion it professes does not at all countenance. It has an
      almost morbidly pronounced simultaneous sense of the joys and the sorrows
      of human life, the enjoyment of the joys being perfectly frank, and the
      feeling of the sorrows not in the least sentimental. It unites a great
      general refinement of thought, manners, opinion, with an almost
      astonishing occasional coarseness of opinion, manners, thought. The
      prevailing note in it is a profound melancholy mixed with flashes and
      intervals of a no less profound delight. There is in it the sense of
      death, to a strange and, at first sight, almost unintelligible extent.
      Only when one remembers the long night of the religious wars which was
      just about to fall on France, just as after Spenser, Puritan as he was,
      after Carew and Herrick still more, a night of a similar character was
      about to fall on England, does the real reason of this singular
      idiosyncrasy appear. The company of the <i>Heptameron</i> are the latest
      representatives, at first hand, and with no deliberate purpose of
      presentment, of the mediaeval conception of gentlemen and ladies who
      fleeted the time goldenly. They are not themselves any longer mediaeval;
      they have been taught modern ways; they have a kind of uneasy sense (even
      though one and another of themselves may now and then flout the idea) of
      the importance of other classes, even of some duty on their own part
      towards other classes. Their piety is a very little deliberate, their
      voluptuous indulgence has a grain of conscience in it and behind it, which
      distinguishes it not less from the frank indulgence of a Greek or a Roman
      than from the still franker naïveté of purely mediaeval art, from the
      childlike, almost paradisiac, innocence of the Belli-cents and Nicolettes
      and of the daughter of the great Soldan Hugh in that wonderful serio-comic
      <i>chanson</i> of the <i>Voyage à Constantinople</i>. The mark of
      modernity is on them, and yet they are so little conscious of it, and so
      perfectly free from even the slightest touch of at least its
      anti-religious influence. Nobody, not even Hircan, the Grammont of the
      sixteenth century; not even Nomerfide, the Miss Notable of her day and
      society; not even the haughty lady Ennasuite, who wonders whether common
      folk can be supposed to have like passions with us, feels the abundant
      religious services and the periods of meditation unconscionable or
      tiresome.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so we have here three notes constantly sounding together or in
      immediate sequence. There is the passion of that exquisite <i>rondeau</i>
      of Marot&rsquo;s, which some will have, perhaps not impossibly, to refer to
      Margaret herself&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     En la baisant m&rsquo;a dit: &ldquo;Amy sans blasme,
     Ce seul baiser, qui deux bouches embasme,
     Les arrhes sont du bien tant espéré,&rdquo;
      Ce mot elle a doulcement proféré,
     Pensant du tout apaiser ma grand flamme.
     Mais le mien cour adonc plus elle enflamme,
     Car son alaine odorant plus que basme
     Souffloit le feu qu&rsquo;Amour m&rsquo;a préparé,
     En la baisant.

     Bref, mon esprit, sans congnoissance d&rsquo;âme,
     Vivoit alors sur la bouche à ma dame,
     Dont se mouroit le corps énamouré;
     Et si la lèvre eust guères demouré
     Contre la mienne, elle m&rsquo;eust succé l&rsquo;âme,
     En la baisant.
</pre>
    <p>
      There is the devout meditation of Oisille, and that familiarity with the
      Scriptures which, as Hircan himself says, &ldquo;I trow we all read and know.&rdquo;
       And then there is the note given by two other curious stories of Brantôme.
      One tells how the Queen of Navarre watched earnestly for hours by the
      bedside of a dying maid of honour, that she might see whether the parting
      of the soul was a visible fact or not. The second tells how when some
      talked before her of the joys of heaven, she sighed and said, &ldquo;Well, I
      know that this is true; but we dwell so long dead underground before we
      arise thither.&rdquo; There, in a few words, is the secret of <i>THE HEPTAMERON</i>:
      the fear of God, the sense of death, the voluptuous longing and voluptuous
      regret for the good things of life and love that pass away.

     1 As I have spoken so strongly of the attempts to identify
     the personages of the <i>Heptameron</i>, it might seem
     discourteous not to mention that one of the most
     enthusiastic and erudite English students of Margaret,
     Madame Darmesteter (Miss Mary Robinson), appears to be
     convinced of the possibility and advisableness of
     discovering these originals. Everything that this lady

      Madam, That great oracle of God, St. John Chrysostom, deplores with
      infinite compassion in some part of his works the disaster and calamity of
      his century, in which not only was the memory of an infinity of
      illustrious persons cut off from among mankind, but, what is more, their
      writings, by which the rich conceptions of their souls and the divine
      ornaments of their minds were to have been consecrated to posterity, did
      not survive them. And certainly with most manifest reason did this good
      and holy man address such a complaint to the whole Christian Republic,
      touched as he was with just grief for an infinity of thousands of books,
      of which some have been lost and buried in eternal forgetfulness by the
      negligence of men, others dispersed and destroyed by the cruel incursions
      of war, others rotted and spoiled as much by the rigour of time as by
      carelessness to collect and preserve them; whereof the ancient Histories
      and Annals furnish a sufficient example in the memorable library of that
      great King of Egypt, Ptolemy Phila-delphus, which had been formed with the
      sweat and blood of so many notable philosophers, and maintained, ordered,
      and preserved by the liberality of that great monarch. And yet in less
      than a day, by the monstrous and abominable cruelty of the soldiers of
      Cæsar, when the latter followed Pompey to Alexandria, it was burned and
      reduced to ashes. Zonarius, the ecclesiastical historian, writes that the
      same happened at Constantinople in the time of Zeno, when a superb and
      magnificent palace, adorned with all sorts of manuscript books, was burnt,
      to the eternal regret and insupportable detriment of all those who made a
      profession of letters. And without amusing ourselves too curiously in
      recounting the destruction among the ancients, we have in our time
      experienced a similar loss&mdash;of which the memory is so recent that the
      wounds thereof still bleed in all parts of Europe&mdash;namely, when the
      Turks besieged Buda, the capital of Hungary, where the most celebrated
      library of the good King Matthias was pillaged, dispersed, and destroyed;
      a library which, without sparing any expense, he had enriched with all the
      rarest and most excellent books, Greek, Latin, Hebrew, and Arabic, that he
      had been able to collect in all the most famous provinces of the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, he who would particularise and closely examine things will find
      that Theophrastes, as he himself declares, wrote and composed three
      hundred volumes, Chrysippus sixty, Empedocles fifty, Servus Sulpicius two
      hundred on civil law, Gallienus one hundred and thirty on the art of
      medicine, and Origenes six thousand, all of which St. Jerome attests
      having read; and yet, of so many admirable and excellent authors, there
      now remain to us only some little fragments, so debased and vitiated in
      several places, that they seem abortive, and as if they had been torn from
      their author&rsquo;s hands by force.
    </p>
    <p>
      On account of which, my Lady, since the occasion has offered, I have been
      minded to present all these examples, with the object of exhorting all
      those who treasure books and keep them sequestered in their sanctuaries
      and cabinets, to henceforth publish them and bring them to light, not only
      so that they may not keep back and bury the glory of their ancestors, but
      also that they may not deprive their descendants of the profit and
      pleasure which they might derive from the labour of others.
    </p>
    <p>
      In regard to myself, I will set forth more amply in the notice which I
      will give to the reader the motive that induced me to put my hand to the
      work of the present author, who has no need of trumpet and herald to exalt
      and magnify her(1) greatness, inasmuch as there is no human eloquence that
      could portray her more forcibly than she has portrayed herself by the
      celestial strokes of her own brush; I mean by her other writings, in which
      she has so well expressed the sincerity of her doctrines, the vivacity of
      her faith, and the uprightness of her morals, that the most learned men
      who reigned in her time were not ashamed to call her a prodigy and miracle
      of nature. And albeit that Heaven, jealous of our welfare, has snatched
      her from this mortal habitation, yet her virtues rendered her so admirable
      and so engraved her in the memory of every one, that the injury and lapse
      of time cannot efface her from it; for we shall ceaselessly mourn and
      lament for her, like Antimachus the Greek poet wept for Lysidichea, his
      wife, with sad verses and delicate elegies which describe and reveal, her
      virtues and merits.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  In the French text Boaistuau invariably refers to the
     author as a personage of the masculine sex, with the evident
     object of concealing the real authorship of the work.
     Feminine pronouns have, however, been substituted in the
     translation, as it is Queen Margaret who is referred to.
     &mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      Therefore, my Lady, as this work is about to be exposed to the doubtful
      judgment of so many thousands of men, may it please you to take it under
      your protection and into your safe keeping; for, whereas you are the
      natural and legitimate heiress of all the excellencies, ornaments, and
      virtues which enriched the author while she adorned by her presence the
      surprise of the earth, and which now by some marvellous ray of divinity
      live and display themselves in you, it is not possible that you should be
      defrauded of the fruit of the labour which justly belongs to you, and for
      which the whole universe will be indebted to you now that it comes forth
      into the light under the resplendent shelter of your divine and heroic
      virtues.
    </p>
    <p>
      May it therefore please you, my Lady, to graciously accept of this little
      offering, as an eternal proof of my obedience and most humble devotion to
      your greatness, pending a more important sacrifice which I prepare for the
      future.

      Peter Boaistuau, surnamed Launay, To the Reader.(1)
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1 This notice follows the dedicatory preface in the edition
     of 1558.
</pre>
    <p>
      Gentle Reader, I can tell thee verily and with good right assert (even
      prove by witnesses worthy of belief) when this work was presented to me
      that I might fulfil the office of a sponge and cleanse it of a multitude
      of manifest errors that were found in a copy written by hand, I was only
      requested to take out or copy eighteen or twenty of the more notable
      tales, reserving myself to complete the rest at a more convenient season
      and at greater leisure.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, as men are fond of novelties, I was solicited with very pressing
      requests to pursue my point, to which I consented, rather by reason of the
      importunity than of my own will, and my enterprise was conducted in such
      fashion, that so as not to show myself in any wise disobedient, I added
      some more tales, to which again others have since been adjoined.
    </p>
    <p>
      In regard to myself, I can assure thee that it would have been less
      difficult for me to build the whole edifice anew than to mutilate it in
      several places, change, innovate, add and suppress in others, but I was
      almost perforce compelled to give it a new form, which I have done, partly
      for the requirements and the adornment of the stories, partly to conform
      to the times and the infelicity of our century, when most human things are
      so exulcerated that there is no work, however well digested, polished, and
      filed, but it is badly interpreted and slandered by the malice of
      fastidious persons. Take, therefore, in good part our hasty labour, and be
      not too close a censor of another&rsquo;s work until thou hast examined thine
      own.

      <i>To the most Illustrious and Virtuous Princess</i>, Madame Jane de Foix,

    <p>
      Queen of Navarre,
    </p>
    <p>
      Claud Gruget, her very humble servant, presents salutation and wishes of
      felicity. (1)
    </p>
    <p>
      I would not have interfered, Madam, to present you with this book of the
      Tales of the late Queen, your mother, if the first edition had not omitted
      or concealed her name, and almost entirely changed its form, to such a
      point that many did not recognise it; on which account, to render it
      worthy of its author, I, as soon as it was divulged, gathered together
      from all sides the copies I could collect of it written by hand, verifying
      them by my copy, and acting in such wise that I arranged the book in the
      real order in which she had drawn it up. Then, with the permission of the
      King and your consent, it was sent to the press to be published such as it
      should be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Concerning it, I am reminded of what Count Balthazar says of Boccaccio in
      the Preface to his <i>Courtier</i>(2) that what he had done by way of
      pastime, namely, his <i>Decameron</i>, had brought him more honour than
      all his other works in Latin or Tuscan, which he esteemed the most
      serious.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  This preface was inserted in the edition issued in 1559
     by Claud Gruget, who gave the title of &ldquo;<i>Heptameron</i>&rdquo; to
     Queen Margaret&rsquo;s tales.

     2  The <i>Libro del Cortegiano</i>, by Count Baldassare
     Castiglione, was the nobleman&rsquo;s <i>vade-mecum</i> of the period.
     First published at Venice in 1528, it was translated into
     French in 1537 by J. Colin, secretary to Francis I.&mdash;Ed.

    <p>
      Thus, the Queen, that true ornament of our century, from whom you do not
      derogate in the love and knowledge of good letters, while amusing herself
      with the acts of human life, has left such beauteous instructions that
      there is no one who does not find matter of erudition in them; and,
      indeed, according to all good judgment, she has surpassed Boccaccio in the
      beautiful Discourses which she composes upon each of her tales. For which
      she deserves praise, not only over the most excellent ladies, but also
      among the most learned men; for of the three styles of oration described
      by Cicero, she has chosen the simple one, similar to that of Terence in
      Latin, which to every one seems very easy to imitate, though it is
      anything but that to him who tries it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is true that such a present will not be new to you, and that you will
      only recognise in it the maternal inheritance. However, I feel assured
      that you will receive it favourably, at seeing it, in this second
      impression, restored to its original state, for according to what I have
      heard the first displeased you. Not that he who put his hand to it was not
      a learned man, or did not take trouble; indeed it is easy to believe that
      he was not minded to disguise it thus, without some reason; nevertheless
      his work has proved unpleasing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I present it to you then, Madam, not that I pretend to any share in it,
      but only as having unmasked it to restore it to you in its natural state.
      It is for Your Royal Greatness to favour it since it proceeds from your
      illustrious House, whereof it bears the mark upon the front, which will
      serve it as a safe-conduct throughout the world and render it welcome
      among good company.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for myself, recognising the honour that you will do me in receiving
      from my hand the work thus restored to its right state, I shall ever feel
      obliged to render you most humble duty.

    <h2>
      PROLOGUE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the first day of September, when the baths in the Pyrenees Mountains
      begin to be possessed of their virtue, there were at those of Cauterets(1)
      many persons as well of France as of Spain, some to drink the water,
      others to bathe in it, and again others to make trial of the mud; all
      these being remedies so marvellous that persons despaired of by the
      doctors return thence wholly cured. My purpose is not to speak to you of
      the situation or virtue of the said baths, but only to set forth as much
      as relates to the matter of which I desire to write.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1 There are no fewer than twenty-six sources at Cauterets,
     the waters being either of a sulphureous or a saline
     character. The mud baths alluded to by Margaret were
     formerly taken at the Source de César Vieux, half-way up
     Mount Peyraute, and so called owing to a tradition that
     Julius Cæsar bathed there. It is at least certain that these
     baths were known to the Romans.&mdash;Ed.

     Cauterets is frequently mentioned by the old authors, and
     Rabelais refers to it in this passage: &ldquo;Pantagruel&rsquo;s urine
     was so hot that ever since that time it has not cooled, and
     you have some of it in France, at divers places, at
     Coderetz, Limous, Dast, Ballerue, Bourbonne, and
     elsewhere&rdquo;(Book ii. chap, xxxiii.).&mdash;M.
</pre>
    <p>
      All the sick persons continued at the baths for more than three weeks,
      until by the amendment in their condition they perceived that they might
      return home again. But while they were preparing to do so, there fell such
      extraordinary rains that it seemed as though God had forgotten the promise
      He made to Noah never to destroy the world with water again; for every
      cottage and every lodging in Cauterets was so flooded with water that it
      was no longer possible to continue there. Those who had come from the side
      of Spain returned thither across the mountains as best they could, and
      such of them as knew whither the roads led fared best in making their
      escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      The French lords and ladies thought to return to Tarbes as easily as they
      had come, but they found the streamlets so deep as to be scarcely
      fordable. When they came to pass over the Bearnese Gave,(1) which at the
      time of their former passage had been less than two feet in depth, they
      found it so broad and swift that they turned aside to seek for the
      bridges. But these being only of wood, had been swept away by the
      turbulence of the water.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1 The Basques give the name of Gave to those watercourses
     which become torrents in certain seasons. The Bearnese Gave,
     so named because it passes through the territory of the
     ancient city of Beam, takes its source in the Pyrenees, and
     flows past Pau to Sorde, where it joins the Adour, which
     falls into the sea at Bayonne. It is nowadays generally
     known as the Gave of Pau.&mdash;L. &amp; M.
</pre>
    <p>
      Then certain of the company thought to stem the force of the current by
      crossing in a body, but they were quickly carried away, and the others who
      had been about to follow lost all inclination to do so. Accordingly they
      separated, as much because they were not all of one mind as to find some
      other way. Some crossed over the mountains, and passing through Aragon
      came to the county of Rousillon, and thence to Narbonne; whilst others
      made straight for Barcelona, going thence by sea, some to Marseilles and
      others to Aigues-Mortes.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a widow lady of long experience, named Oisille, resolved to lay aside
      all fear of bad roads and to betake herself to Our Lady of Serrance.(3)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     3 The Abbey of Our Lady of Serrance, or more correctly
     Sarrances, in the valley of Aspe, was occupied by monks of
     the Prémontré Order, who were under the patronage of St.
     Mary. An apparition of the Virgin having been reported in
     the vicinity, pilgrimages were made to Sarrances on the
     feasts of her nativity (Sept. 8) and her assumption (Aug.
     15). In 1385 Gaston de Foix, who greatly enriched the abbey,
     built a residence in the neighbourhood, his example being
     followed by the Gramonts, the Miollens, and other nobles.
     The pilgrimages had become very celebrated in the fifteenth
     century, when Louis XI. repaired to Sarrances, accompanied
     by Coictier, his physician. In 1569,  however,  the
     Huguenots pillaged and burned down the abbey, together with
     the royal and other residences. The monks who escaped the
     flames were put to the sword.&mdash;M. &amp; Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      She was not, indeed, so superstitious as to think that the glorious Virgin
      would leave her seat at her Son&rsquo;s right hand to come and dwell in a
      desolate country, but she was desirous to see the hallowed spot of which
      she had so often heard, and further she was sure that if there were a
      means of escaping from a danger, the monks would certainly find it out. At
      last she arrived, after passing through places so strange, and so
      difficult in the going up and coming down, that, in spite of her years and
      weight, she had perforce gone most of the way on foot But the most piteous
      thing was, that the greater part of her servants and horses were left dead
      on the way, and she had but one man and one woman with her on arriving at
      Serrance, where she was charitably received by the monks.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were also among the French two gentlemen who had gone to the baths
      rather that they might be in the company of the ladies whose lovers they
      were, than because of any failure in their health. These gentlemen, seeing
      that the company was departing and that the husbands of their ladies were
      taking them away, resolved to follow them at a distance without making
      their design known to any one. But one evening, while the two married
      gentlemen and their wives were in the house of one who was more of a
      robber than a peasant, the two lovers, who were lodged in a farmhouse hard
      by, heard about midnight a great uproar. They got up, together with their
      serving-men, and inquired what this tumult meant. The poor man, in great
      fear, told them that it was caused by certain evil-doers who were come to
      share the spoil which was in the house of their fellow-bandit. Thereupon
      the gentlemen immediately took their arms, and with their serving-men set
      forth to succour the ladies, esteeming it a happier thing to die for them
      than to outlive them.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they reached the house, they found the first door broken through, and
      the two gentlemen with their servants defending themselves valiantly. But
      inasmuch as they were outnumbered by the robbers, and were also sorely
      wounded, they were beginning to fall back, having already lost many of
      their servants. The two gentlemen, looking in at the windows, perceived
      the ladies shrieking and sobbing so bitterly that their hearts swelled
      with pity and love at the sight; and, like two enraged bears coming down
      from the mountains, they fell upon the bandits with such fury that many of
      them were slain, while the remainder, unwilling to await their onset, fled
      to a hiding-place which was known to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the gentlemen had worsted these rogues and had slain the host himself
      among the rest, they heard that the man&rsquo;s wife was even worse than her
      husband; and they therefore sent her after him with a sword-thrust. Then
      they entered a lower room, where they found one of the married gentlemen
      on the point of death. The other had received no hurt, save that his
      clothes were all pierced with thrusts and that his sword was broken in
      two. The poor gentleman, perceiving what help the two had afforded him,
      embraced and thanked them, and besought them not to abandon him, which was
      to them a very agreeable request. When they had buried the dead gentleman,
      and had comforted his wife as well as they were able, they took the road
      which God set before them, not knowing whither they were going.
    </p>
    <p>
      If it pleases you to know the names of the three gentlemen, the married
      one was called Hircan, and his wife Parlamente, the name of the widow
      being Longarine; of the two lovers one was called Dagoucin and the other
      Saffredent. After having been the whole day on horseback, towards evening
      they descried a belfry, whither with toil and trouble they made the best
      of their way, and on their arrival were kindly received by the Abbot and
      the monks. The abbey is called St. Savyn.(4)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     4 The Abbey of St. Savin of Tarbes, situated between Argelèz
     and Pierrefitte, in what was formerly called the county of
     Lavedan, is stated to have been founded by Charlemagne; and
     here the Paladin Roland is said to have slain the giants
     Alabaster and Passamont to recompense the monks for their
     hospitality. The abbey took its name from a child (the son
     of a Count of Barcelona) who led a hermit&rsquo;s life, and is
     accredited with having performed several miracles in the
     neighbourhood. About the year 1100 the Pope, siding with the
     people of the valley of Aspe in a quarrel between them and
     the Abbot of St. Savin, issued a bull forbidding the women
     of Lavedan to conceive for a period of seven years. The
     animals, moreover, were not to bring forth young, and the
     trees were not to bear fruit for a like period. The edict
     remained in force for six years, when the Abbot of St. Savin
     compromised matters by engaging to pay an annual tribute to
     Aspe. This tribute was actually paid until the Revolution of
     1789. On the other hand, the abbey was entitled to the right
     shoulder of every stag, boar, and izard (the Pyrenean
     chamois) killed in the valley, with other tributes of trout,
     cheese, and flowers, which last the Abbot acknowledged by
     kissing the prettiest maiden of Argelèz. Amongst various
     privileges possessed by the monks was that of having their
     beds made by the girls of the neighbourhood on certain high
     days and holidays.

     In the tenth century Raymond of Bigorre presented the abbey
     with the valley of Cauterets on condition that a church
     should be built there and &ldquo;sufficient houses kept in repair
     to facilitate the using of the baths.&rdquo; In 1290 Edward III.
     of England confirmed the monks of St. Savin in possession of
     Cauterets. In 1316, when the inhabitants of the latter place
     wished to change the situation of their village, the Abbot
     of St. Savin consented, but a woman opposed her veto (all
     women had the right of vote) and this sufficed to frustrate
     the scheme. The abbey derived a considerable income from
     Cauterets, the baths and the houses built there for the
     accommodation of visitors being let out on lease. The leases
     of 1617 and 1697 are preserved in the archives of Pau. In
     the time of Queen Margaret the abbey was extremely wealthy;
     the Abbot to whom she refers, according to M. Le Roux de
     Lincy, was probably Raymond de Fontaine, who ruled St. Savin
     from 1534 to 1540, under the authority of the commendatory
     abbots, Anthony de Rochefort and Nicholas Dangu, Bishop of
     Séez. Some of the commentators of the <i>Heptameron</i> believe
     the latter to have been the original &ldquo;Dagoucin&rdquo; who is
     supposed to tell several of the tales.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      The Abbot, who came of an ancient line, lodged them honourably, and when
      taking them to their apartments inquired of them concerning their
      adventures. When he had heard the truth, he told them that others had
      fared as badly as they, for in one of his rooms he had two ladies who had
      escaped a like danger, or perchance a greater, inasmuch as they had had to
      do with beasts, and not with men. (5) Half a league on this side of
      Peyrechitte (6) the poor ladies had met with a bear coming down from the
      mountain, before whom they had fled with such speed that their horses fell
      dead under them at the abbey gates. Further, two of their women who
      arrived a long time afterwards had made report that the bear had killed
      all the serving-men.

     5  In two MS. copies of the <i>Heptameron</i> in the Bibliothèque
     Nationale, Paris, numbered respectively 1520 and 1524, after
     the words &ldquo;not with men&rdquo; there follows &ldquo;in men there is some
     mercy, but in animals none.&rdquo;&mdash;L.

     6  Peyrechitte is evidently intended for Pierrefitte, a
     village on the left bank of the Gave, between Argelèz and
     Cauterets.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      Then the two ladies and the three gentlemen entered the room where these
      unhappy travellers were, and found them weeping. They recognised them to
      be Nomerfide and Ennasuite, whereupon they all embraced and recounted what
      had befallen them. At the exhortations of the good Abbot they began to
      take comfort in having found one another again, and in the morning they
      heard mass with much devotion, praising God for the perils from which they
      had escaped.
    </p>
    <p>
      While they were all at mass there came into the church (7) a man clad only
      in a shirt, fleeing as though he were pursued, and crying out for aid.
      Forthwith Hircan and the other gentlemen went to meet him to see what the
      affair might mean, and perceived two men behind him with drawn swords.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (7) This church is still in existence. It is mainly in the
     Romanesque style and almost destitute of ornamentation.
     There are, however, some antique paintings of St. Savin&rsquo;s
     miracles; and the saint&rsquo;s tomb, which is still preserved, is
     considered to be some twelve hundred years old. The village
     is gathered about the church, and forms a wide street lined
     with houses of the fifteenth century, which Margaret and her
     friends must have gazed upon during their sojourn here.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      These, on seeing so great a company, sought to fly, but they were hotly
      pursued by Hircan and his companions, and so lost their lives. When Hircan
      came back, he found that the man in the shirt was one of his companions
      named Geburon, who related to them how while he was in bed at a farmhouse
      near Peyrechitte three men came upstairs, and how he, although he was in
      his shirt and had no other weapon but his sword, had stretched one of them
      on the ground mortally wounded. While the other two were occupied in
      raising their companion, he, perceiving himself to be naked and the others
      armed, bethought him that he could not outdo them except it were by
      flight, as being the least encumbered with clothes. And so he had escaped,
      and for this he praised God and those who had avenged him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had heard mass and had dined they sent to see if it was possible
      to cross the river Gave, and on learning that it was not, they were in
      great dismay. However, the Abbot urgently entreated them to stay with him
      until the water had abated, and they agreed to remain for that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening, as they were going to bed, there arrived an aged monk who
      was wont to come in September of every year to Our Lady of Serrance. They
      inquired of him concerning his journey, and he told them that on account
      of the floods he had come over the mountains and by the worst roads he had
      ever known. On the way he had seen a very pitiful sight. He had met a
      gentleman named Simontault, who, wearied by his long waiting for the river
      to subside, and trusting to the goodness of his horse, had tried to force
      a passage, and had placed all his servants round about him to break the
      force of the current. But when they were in the midst of the stream, those
      who were the worst mounted were swept away, horses and men, down the
      stream, and were never seen again. The gentleman, finding himself alone,
      turned his horse to go back, but before he could reach the bank his horse
      sank under him. Nevertheless, God willed that this should happen so close
      to the bank that the gentleman was able, by dragging himself on all fours
      and not without swallowing a great deal of water, to scramble out on to
      the hard stones, though he was then so weak and weary that he could not
      stand upright.
    </p>
    <p>
      By good fortune a shepherd, bringing back his sheep at even, found him
      seated among the stones, wet to the skin, and sad not only for himself but
      on account of his servants whom he had seen perish before his eyes. The
      shepherd, who understood his need even better from his appearance than
      from his speech, took him by the hand and led him to his humble dwelling,
      where he kindled some faggots, and so dried him in the best way that he
      could. The same evening God led thither this good monk, who showed him the
      road to Our Lady of Serrance assuring him that he would be better lodged
      there than anywhere else, and would there find an aged widow named Oisille
      who had been as unfortunate as himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      When all the company heard tell of the good Lady Oisille and the gentle
      knight Simontault, they were exceedingly glad, and praised the Creator,
      who, content with the sacrifice of serving-folk, had preserved their
      masters and mistresses. And more than all the rest did Parlamente give
      hearty praise to God, for Simontault had long been her devoted lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they made diligent inquiry concerning the road to Serrance, and
      although the good old man declared it to be very difficult, they were not
      to be debarred from attempting to proceed thither that very day. They set
      forth well furnished with all that was needful, for the Abbot provided
      them with wine and abundant victuals,(8) and with willing companions to
      lead them safely over the mountains.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     8 According to MS. No. 1520 (Bib. Nat., Paris), the Abbot
     also furnished them with the best horses of Lavedan and good
     &ldquo;cappes&rdquo; of Beam. The Lavedan horses were renowned for their
     speed and spirit, and the Bearnese cappe was a cloak
     provided with a hood.&mdash;B. J.
</pre>
    <p>
      These they crossed more often on foot than on horseback, and after much
      toil and sweat came to Our Lady of Serrance. Here the Abbot, although
      somewhat evilly disposed, durst not deny them lodging for fear of the Lord
      of Beam,(9) who, as he was aware, held them in high esteem. Being a true
      hypocrite, he showed them as fair a countenance as he could, and took them
      to see the Lady Oisille and the gentle knight Simontault.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     9 The Kings of Navarre had been Lords of Beam for two
     centuries, but Beam still retained its old customs and had
     its special government. The Lord of Beam here referred to
     was Henry d&rsquo;Albret, Margaret&rsquo;s second husband.&mdash;B. J.
</pre>
    <p>
      The joyfulness of all this company who had been thus miraculously brought
      together was so great that the night seemed short to them while praising
      God in the Church for the goodness that He had shown to them. When towards
      morning they had taken a little rest, they all went to hear mass and
      receive the holy sacrament of fellowship, in which all Christians are
      joined together as one, imploring Him who of His mercy had thus united
      them, that He would further their journey to His glory. After they had
      dined they sent to learn whether the waters were at all abated, and found
      that, on the contrary, they were rather increased, and could not be
      crossed with safety for a long time to come. They therefore determined to
      make a bridge resting on two rocks which come very close together, and
      where there are still planks for those foot-passengers who, coming from
      Oleron, wish to avoid crossing at the ford. The Abbot was well pleased
      that they should make this outlay, to the end that the number of pilgrims
      might be increased, and he furnished them with workmen, though he was too
      avaricious to give them a single farthing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The workmen declared that they could not finish the bridge in less than
      ten or twelve days, and all the company, both ladies and gentlemen, began
      to grow weary. But Parlamente, who was Hircan&rsquo;s wife, and who was never
      idle or melancholy, asked leave of her husband to speak, and said to the
      aged Lady Oisille&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am surprised, madam, that you who have so much experience, and now fill
      the place of mother to all of us women, do not devise some pastime to
      relieve the weariness we shall feel during our long stay; for if we have
      not some pleasant and virtuous occupation we shall be in danger of falling
      ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; added the young widow Longarine, &ldquo;worse than that, we shall become
      ill-tempered, which is an incurable disease; for there is not one among us
      but has cause to be exceeding downcast, having regard to our several
      losses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ennasuite laughing replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every one has not lost her husband like you, and the loss of servants
      need not bring despair, since others may readily be found. Nevertheless, I
      too am of opinion that we should have some pleasant exercise with which to
      while away the time, for otherwise we shall be dead by to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All the gentlemen agreed with what these ladies said, and begged Oisille
      to tell them what they should do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My children,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;you ask me for something which I find very
      difficult to teach you, namely, a pastime that may deliver you from your
      weariness. I have sought for such a remedy all my life and have never
      found but one, which is the reading of the Holy Scriptures. In them the
      mind may find that true and perfect joy from which repose and bodily
      health proceed. If you would know by what means I continue so blithe and
      healthy in my old age, it is because on rising I immediately take up the
      Holy Scriptures (10) and read therein, and so perceive and contemplate the
      goodness of God, who sent His Son into the world to proclaim to us the
      Sacred Word and glad tidings by which He promises the remission of all
      sins and the satisfaction of all debts by the gift that He has made us of
      His love, passion, and merits.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     10  Margaret read a portion of the Scriptures every day,
     saying that the perusal preserved one &ldquo;from all sorts of
     evils and diabolical temptations&rdquo; (<i>Histoire de Foix, Béarn,
     et Navarre</i>, by P. Olhagaray, Paris, 1609, p. 502).&mdash;L.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The thought of this gives me such joy that I take my Psalter and in all
      humility sing with my heart and utter with my lips the sweet psalms and
      canticles which the Holy Spirit put into the heart of David and of other
      writers. And so acceptable is the contentment that this brings to me, that
      any evils which may befall me during the day I look upon as blessings,
      seeing that I have in my heart, through faith, Him who has borne them all
      for me. In the same way before supper I retire to feed my soul by reading,
      and then in the evening I call to mind all I have done during the past
      day, in order that I may ask forgiveness for my sins, thank Him for His
      mercies, and, feeling safe from all harm, take my rest in His love, fear,
      and peace. This, my children, is the pastime I have long practised, after
      making trial of all others and finding in none contentment of spirit. I
      believe that if you give an hour every morning to reading and then offer
      up devout prayers during mass, you will find in this lonely place all the
      beauty that any town could afford. One who knows God sees all things fair
      in Him, and without Him everything seems uncomely; wherefore, I pray you,
      accept my advice, if you would live in gladness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Hircan took up the discourse and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those, madam, who have read the Holy Scriptures, as I believe we all have
      done, will acknowledge that what you have said is true. You must, however,
      consider that we are not yet so mortified that we have not need of some
      pastime and bodily exercise. When we are at home we have the chase and
      hawking, which cause us to lay aside a thousand foolish thoughts, and the
      ladies have their household cares, their work, and sometimes the dance, in
      all which they find honourable exercise. So, speaking on behalf of the
      men, I propose that you, who are the oldest, read to us in the morning
      about the life that was led by Our Lord Jesus Christ and the great and
      wonderful works that He did for us; and that between dinner and vespers we
      choose some pastime that shall be pleasant to the body and yet not hurtful
      to the soul. In this way we shall pass the day cheerfully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Lady Oisille replied that she had been at pains to forget every
      description of worldly vanity, and she therefore feared that she should
      succeed but ill in the choice of such an entertainment. The matter must be
      decided by the majority of opinions, and she begged Hircan to set forth
      his own first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my part,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if I thought that the pastime I should choose
      would be as agreeable to the company as to myself, my opinion would soon
      be given. For the present, however, I withhold it, and will abide by what
      the rest shall say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His wife Parlamente, thinking he referred to her, began to blush, and,
      half in anger and half laughing, replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps, Hircan, she who you think would find it most dull might readily
      find means of compensation had she a mind for it. But let us leave aside a
      pastime in which only two can share, and speak of one that shall be common
      to all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since my wife has understood the meaning of my words so well,&rdquo; said
      Hircan to all the ladies, &ldquo;and a private pastime is not to her liking, I
      think she will be better able than any one else to name one that all may
      enjoy; and I herewith give in to her opinion, having no other of my own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this all the company agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parlamente, perceiving that it had fallen to her to decide, spoke as
      follows&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I find myself as capable as the ancients who invented the arts, I
      should devise some sport or pastime in fulfilment of the charge you lay
      upon me. But knowing as I do my knowledge and capacity, which are scarcely
      able to recall the worthy performances of others, I shall think myself
      happy if I can follow closely such as have already satisfied your request.
      Among the rest, I think there is not one of you who has not read the
      Hundred Tales of Boccaccio, (11) lately translated from the Italian into
      French. So highly were these thought of by King Francis, first of that
      name, Monseigneur the Dauphin, (12) Madame the Dauphiness, and Madame
      Margaret, that could Boccaccio have only heard them from the place where
      he lay, the praise of such illustrious persons would have raised him from
      the dead.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     11  Margaret here alludes to the French translation of the
     <i>Decameron</i> made by her secretary, Anthony le Maçon, and
     first issued in Paris in 1545. Messrs. De Lincy and
     Montaiglon accordingly think that the prologue of the
     <i>Heptameron</i> was written subsequently to that date; but M.
     Dillaye states that Le Maçon&rsquo;s translation was circulated at
     Court in manuscript long before it was printed. This
     contention is in some measure borne out by Le Maçon&rsquo;s
     dedication to Margaret, of which the more interesting
     passages are given in the Appendix to this volume (A).&mdash;ED.

     12  The Dauphin here mentioned is Francis I.&lsquo;s second son,
     who subsequently reigned as Henry II. He became Dauphin by
     the death of his elder brother on August 10, 1536. The
     Dauphiness is Catherine de&rsquo; Medici, the wife of Henry, whom
     he married in 1533; whilst Madame Margaret, according to M.
     de Montaiglon, is the Queen of Navarre herself, she being
     usually called by that name at her brother&rsquo;s Court. M.
     Dillaye, who is of a different opinion, maintains that the
     Queen would not write so eulogistically of herself, and that
     she evidently refers to her brother&rsquo;s daughter, Margaret de
     Berry, born in 1523, and married to the Duke of Savoy.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      Now I heard not long since that the two ladies I have mentioned, together
      with several others of the Court, determined to do like Boccaccio, with,
      however, one exception&mdash;they would not write any story that was not a
      true one. And the said ladies, and Monseigneur the Dauphin with them,
      undertook to tell ten stories each, and to assemble in all ten persons,
      from among those whom they thought the most capable of relating something.
      Such as had studied and were people of letters were excepted, for
      Monseigneur the Dauphin would not allow of their art being brought in,
      fearing lest the flowers of rhetoric should in some wise prove injurious
      to the truth of the tales. But the weighty affairs in which the King had
      engaged, the peace between him and the King of England, the bringing to
      bed of the Dauphiness,(13) and many other matters of a nature to engross
      the whole Court, caused the enterprise to be entirely forgotten.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     13 The confinement mentioned here is that of Catherine de
     Medici, who, after remaining childless during ten years of
     wedlock, gave birth to a son, afterwards Francis II., in
     January 1543. The peace previously spoken of would appear to
     be that signed at Crespy in September 1544. Both M. de
     Montaiglon and M. Dillaye are of opinion, however, that a
     word or two is deficient in the MS., and that Margaret
     intended to imply the rupture of peace in 1543, when Henry
     VIII. allied himself with the Emperor Charles V. against
     Francis I.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      By reason, however, of our now great leisure, it can be accomplished in
      ten days, whilst we wait for our bridge to be finished. If it so pleased
      you, we might go every day from noon till four of the clock into yonder
      pleasant meadow beside the river Gave. The trees there are so leafy that
      the sun can neither penetrate the shade nor change the coolness to heat.
      Sitting there at our ease, we might each one tell a story of something we
      have ourselves seen, or heard related by one worthy of belief. At the end
      of ten days we shall have completed the hundred,(14) and if God wills it
      that our work be found worthy in the eyes of the lords and ladies I have
      mentioned, we will on our return from this journey present them with it,
      in lieu of images and paternosters,(15) and feeling assured that they will
      hold this to be a more pleasing gift. If, however, any one can devise some
      plan more agreeable than mine, I will fall in with his opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     14  This passage plainly indicates that the Queen meant to
     pen a Decameron.&mdash;Ed.

     15  This is an allusion to the holy images, medals, and
     chaplets which people brought back with them from
     pilgrimages.&mdash;B. J.
</pre>
    <p>
      All the company replied that it was not possible to give better advice,
      and that they awaited the morning in impatience, in order to begin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus they spent that day joyously, reminding one another of what they had
      seen in their time. As soon as the morning was come they went to the room
      of Madame Oisille, whom they found already at her prayers. They listened
      to her reading for a full hour, then piously heard mass, and afterwards
      went to dinner at ten o&rsquo;clock.(16)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     16 At that period ten o&rsquo;clock was the Court dinner-hour.
     Fifty years earlier people used to dine at eight in the
     morning. Louis XII., however, changed the hour of his meals
     to suit his wife, Mary of England, who had been accustomed
     to dine at noon.&mdash;B. J.
</pre>
    <p>
      After dinner each one withdrew to his chamber, and did what he had to do.
      According to their plan, at noon they failed not to return to the meadow,
      which was so fair and pleasant that it would need a Boccaccio to describe
      it as it really was; suffice to say that a fairer was never seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the company were all seated on the green grass, which was so fine and
      soft that they needed neither cushion nor carpet, Simontault commenced by
      saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which of us shall begin before the others?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since you were the first to speak,&rdquo; replied Hircan,&rdquo; &rsquo;tis reasonable that
      you should rule us; for in sport we are all equal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would to God,&rdquo; said Simontault, &ldquo;I had no worse fortune in this world
      than to be able to rule all the company present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On hearing this Parlamente, who well knew what it meant, began to cough.
      Hircan, therefore, did not perceive the colour that came into her cheeks,
      but told Simontault to begin, which he did as presently follows.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>The wife of a Proctor, having been pressingly solicited by
     the Bishop of Sees, took him for her profit, and, being as
     little satisfied with him as with her husband, found a means
     to have the son of the Lieutenant-General of Alençon for her
     pleasure. Some time afterwards she caused the latter to be
     miserably murdered by her husband, who, although he obtained
     pardon for the murder, was afterwards sent to the galleys
     with a sorcerer named Gallery; and all this was brought
     about by the wickedness of his wife</i>.(1)

      Ladies, said Simontault, I have been so poorly rewarded for my long

    </p>
    <p>
      In the town of Alençon, during the lifetime of Charles, the last Duke,(2)
      there was a Proctor named St. Aignan, who had married a gentlewoman of the
      neighbourhood. She was more beautiful than virtuous, and on account of her
      beauty and light behaviour was much sought after by the Bishop of Sees,(3)
      who, in order to compass his ends, managed the husband so well, that the
      latter not only failed to perceive the vicious conduct of his wife and of
      the Bishop, but was further led to forget the affection he had always
      shown in the service of his master and mistress.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">

     husband.&mdash;Ed.

     3 Sees or Séez, on the Orne, thirteen miles from Alençon,
     and celebrated for its Gothic cathedral, is one of the
     oldest bishoprics in Normandy. Richard Coeur-de-Lion is said
     to have here done penance and obtained absolution for his
     conduct towards his father, Henry II. At the time of this
     story the Bishop of Sees was James de Silly, whose father,
     also James de Silly, Lord of Lonray, Vaux-Pacey, &amp;c, a
     favourite and chamberlain of King Louis XII., became Master
     of the Artillery of France in 1501. The second James de
     Silly&mdash;born at Caen&mdash;was ordained Bishop of Sees on February
     26th, 1511; he was also Abbot of St. Vigor and St. Pierre-
     sur-Dives, where he restored and beautified the abbatial
     church. In 1519 he consecrated a convent for women of noble
     birth, founded by Margaret and her first husband at Essey,
     twenty miles from Alençon, the ruins of which still exist. A
     year later Francis Rometens dedicated to him an edition of
     the letters of Pico della Mirandola. He died April 24th,
     1539, at Fleury-sur-Aiidellé, about fifteen miles from
     Rouen, and was buried in his episcopal church. (See <i>Gallia
     Christiana</i>, vol. xi. p. 702.) His successor in the See of
     Sees was Nicholas Danguye, or Dangu (a natural son of
     Cardinal Duprat), with whom M. Frank tries to identify
     Dagoucin, one of the narrators of the <i>Heptameron</i>.&mdash;L. and
     Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      Thus, from being a loyal servant, he became utterly adverse to them, and
      at last sought out sorcerers to procure the death of the Duchess.(4) Now
      for a long time the Bishop consorted with this unhappy woman, who
      submitted to him from avarice rather than from love, and also because her
      husband urged her to show him favour. But there was a youth in the town of
      Alençon, son of the Lieutenant-General,(5) whom she loved so much that she
      was half crazy regarding him; and she often availed herself of the Bishop
      to have some commission intrusted to her husband, so that she might see
      the son of the Lieutenant, who was named Du Mesnil, at her ease.

     bailiwick and Sénéchaussée of Alençon.&mdash;B. J.
</pre>
    <p>
      This mode of life lasted a long time, during which she had the Bishop for
      her profit and the said Du Mesnil for her pleasure. To the latter she
      swore that she showed a fair countenance to the Bishop only that their own
      love might the more freely continue; that the Bishop, in spite of
      appearances, had obtained only words, from her; and that he, Du Mesnil,
      might rest assured that no man, save himself, should ever receive aught
      else.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, when her husband was setting forth to visit the Bishop, she asked
      leave of him to go into the country, saying that the air of the town was
      injurious to her; and, when she had arrived at her farm, she forthwith
      wrote to Du Mesnil to come and see her, without fail, at about ten o&rsquo;clock
      in the evening. This the young man did; but as he was entering at the gate
      he met the maid who was wont to let him in, and who said to him, &ldquo;Go
      elsewhere, friend, for your place is taken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Supposing that the husband had arrived, he asked her how matters stood.
      The woman, seeing that he was so handsome, youthful, and well-bred, and
      was withal so loving and yet so little loved, took pity upon him and told
      him of his mistress&rsquo;s wantonness, thinking that on hearing this he would
      be cured of loving her so much. She related to him that the Bishop of Sees
      had but just arrived, and was now in bed with the lady, a thing which the
      latter had not expected, for he was not to have come until the morrow.
      However, he had detained her husband at his house, and had stolen away at
      night to come secretly and see her. If ever man was in despair it was Du
      Mesnil, who nevertheless was quite unable to believe the story. He hid
      himself, however, in a house near by, and watched until three hours after
      midnight, when he saw the Bishop come forth disguised, yet not so
      completely but that he could recognise him more readily than he desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Du Mesnil in his despair returned to Alençon, whither, likewise, his
      wicked mistress soon came, and went to speak to him, thinking to deceive
      him according to her wont. But he told her that, having touched sacred
      things, she was too holy to speak to a sinner like himself, albeit his
      repentance was so great that he hoped his sin would very soon be forgiven
      him. When she learnt that her deceit was found out, and that excuses,
      oaths, and promises never to act in a like way again were of no avail, she
      complained of it to her Bishop. Then, having weighed the matter with him,
      she went to her husband and told him that she could no longer dwell in the
      town of Alençon, for the Lieutenant&rsquo;s son, whom he had so greatly esteemed
      among his friends, pursued her unceasingly to rob her of her honour. She
      therefore begged of him to abide at Argentan,(6) in order that all
      suspicion might be removed.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     6  Argentan, on the Orne, twenty-six miles from Alençon, had
     been a distinct viscounty, but at this period it belonged to
     the duchy of Alençon.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      The husband, who suffered himself to be ruled by his wife, consented; but
      they had not been long at Argentan when this bad woman sent a message to
      Du Mesnil, saying that he was the wickedest man in the world, for she knew
      full well that he had spoken evilly (sic.) of her and of the Bishop of
      Sees; however, she would strive her best to make him repent of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man, who had never spoken of the matter except to herself, and
      who feared to fall into the bad graces of the Bishop, repaired to Argentan
      with two of his servants, and finding his mistress at vespers in the
      church of the Jacobins,(7) he went and knelt beside her, and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am come hither, madam, to swear to you before God that I have never
      spoken of your honour to any person but yourself. You treated me so ill
      that I did not make you half the reproaches you deserved; but if there be
      man or woman ready to say that I have ever spoken of the matter to them, I
      am here to give them the lie in your presence.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     7 The name of Jacobins was given to the monks of the
     Dominican Order, some of whom had a monastery in the suburbs
     of Argentan.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      Seeing that there were many people in the church, and that he was
      accompanied by two stout serving-men, she forced herself to speak as
      graciously as she could. She told him that she had no doubt he spoke the
      truth, and that she deemed him too honourable a man to make evil report of
      any one in the world; least of all of herself, who bore him so much
      friendship; but since her husband had heard the matter spoken of, she
      begged him to say in his presence that he had not so spoken and did not so
      believe.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this he willingly agreed, and, wishing to attend her to her house, he
      offered to take her arm; but she told him it was not desirable that he
      should come with her, for her husband would think that she had put these
      words into his mouth. Then, taking one of his serving-men by the sleeve,
      she said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave me this man, and as soon as it is time I will send him to seek you.
      Meanwhile do you go and rest in your lodging.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He, having no suspicion of her conspiracy against him, went thither.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave supper to the serving-man whom she had kept with her, and who
      frequently asked her when it would be time to go and seek his master; but
      she always replied that his master would come soon enough. When it was
      night, she sent one of her own serving-men to fetch Du Mesnil; and he,
      having no suspicion of the mischief that was being prepared for him, went
      boldly to St. Aignan&rsquo;s house. As his mistress was still entertaining his
      servant there, he had but one with himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as he was entering the house, the servant who had been sent to him
      told him that the lady wished to speak with him before he saw her husband,
      and that she was waiting for him in a room where she was alone with his
      own serving-man; he would therefore do well to send his other servant away
      by the front door. This he did. Then while he was going up a small, dark
      stairway, the Proctor St. Aignan, who had placed some men in ambush in a
      closet, heard the noise, and demanded what it was; whereupon he was told
      that a man was trying to enter secretly into his house.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the moment, a certain Thomas Guérin, a murderer by trade, who had been
      hired by the Proctor for the purpose, came forward and gave the poor young
      man so many sword-thrusts that whatever defence he was able to make could
      not save him from falling dead in their midst.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the servant who was waiting with the lady, said to her&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear my master speaking on the stairway. I will go to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the lady stopped him and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not trouble yourself; he will come soon enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A little while afterwards the servant, hearing his master say, &ldquo;I am
      dying, may God receive my soul!&rdquo; wished to go to his assistance, but the
      lady again withheld him, saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not trouble yourself; my husband is only chastising him for his
      follies. We will go and see what it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, leaning over the balustrade at the top of the stairway, she asked
      her husband&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, is it done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come and see,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I have now avenged you on the man who put you
      to such shame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he drove a dagger that he was holding ten or twelve times into
      the belly of a man whom, alive, he would not have dared to assail.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the murder had been accomplished, and the two servants of the dead
      man had fled to carry the tidings to the unhappy father, St. Aignan
      bethought himself that the matter could not be kept secret. But he
      reflected that the testimony of the dead man&rsquo;s servants would not be
      believed, and that no one in his house had seen the deed done, except the
      murderers, and an old woman-servant, and a girl fifteen years of age. He
      secretly tried to seize the old woman, but, finding means to escape out of
      his hands, she sought sanctuary with the Jacobins,(8) and was afterwards
      the most trustworthy witness of the murder. The young maid remained for a
      few days in St. Aignan&rsquo;s house, but he found means to have her led astray
      by one of the murderers, and had her conveyed to a brothel in Paris so
      that her testimony might not be received.(9)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     8  It was still customary to take sanctuary in churches,
     monasteries, and convents at this date, although but little
     respect was shown for the refugees, whose hiding-places were
     often surrounded so that they might be kept without food and
     forced to surrender. After being considerably restricted by
     an edict issued in 1515, the right of sanctuary was
     abolished by Francis I. in 1539.&mdash;B. J. and D.

     9  Prostitutes were debarred from giving evidence in French
     courts of law at this period.&mdash;D.
</pre>
    <p>
      To conceal the murder, he caused the corpse of the hapless dead man to be
      burnt, and the bones which were not consumed by the fire he caused to be
      placed in some mortar in a part of his house where he was building. Then
      he sent in all haste to the Court to sue for pardon, setting forth that he
      had several times forbidden his house to a person whom he suspected of
      plotting his wife&rsquo;s dishonour, and who, notwithstanding his prohibition,
      had come by night to see her in a suspicious fashion; whereupon, finding
      him in the act of entering her room, his anger had got the better of his
      reason and he had killed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But before he was able to despatch his letter to the Chancellor&rsquo;s, the
      Duke and Duchess had been apprised by the unhappy father of the matter,
      and they sent a message to the Chancellor to prevent the granting of the
      pardon. Finding he could not obtain it, the wretched man fled to England
      with his wife and several of his relations. But before setting out he told
      the murderer who at his entreaty had done the deed, that he had seen
      expresses from the King directing that he should be taken and put to
      death. Nevertheless, on account of the service that he had rendered him,
      he desired to save his life, and he gave him ten crowns wherewith to leave
      the kingdom. The murderer did this, and was afterwards seen no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The murder was so fully proven by the servants of the dead man, by the
      woman who had taken refuge with the Jacobins, and by the bones that were
      found in the mortar, that legal proceedings were begun and completed in
      the absence of St. Aignan and his wife. They were judged by default and
      were both condemned to death. Their property was confiscated to the
      Prince, and fifteen hundred crowns were to be given to the dead man&rsquo;s
      father to pay the costs of the trial.
    </p>
    <p>
      St. Aignan being in England and perceiving that in the eyes of the law he
      was dead in France, by means of his services to divers great lords and by
      the favour of his wife&rsquo;s relations, induced the King of England (10) to
      request the King of France (11) to grant him a pardon and restore him to
      his possessions and honours. But the King of France, having been informed
      of the wickedness and enormity of the crime, sent the process to the King
      of England, praying him to consider whether the offence was one deserving
      of pardon, and telling him that no one in the kingdom but the Duke of
      Alençon had the right to grant a pardon in that duchy. However,
      notwithstanding all his excuses, he failed to appease the King of England,
      who continued to entreat him so very pressingly that, at his request, the
      Proctor at last received a pardon and so returned to his own home.(12)
      There, to complete his wickedness, he consorted with a sorcerer named
      Gallery, hoping that by this man&rsquo;s art he might escape payment of the
      fifteen hundred crowns to the dead man&rsquo;s father.

     in view of obtaining his pardon.&mdash;L.
</pre>
    <p>
      To this end he went in disguise to Paris with his wife. She, finding that
      he used to shut himself up for a great while in a room with Gallery
      without acquainting her with the reason thereof, spied upon him one
      morning, and perceived Gallery showing him five wooden images, three of
      which had their hands hanging down, whilst two had them lifted up.(13)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must make waxen images like these,&rdquo; said Gallery, speaking to the
      Proctor. &ldquo;Such as have their arms hanging down will be for those whom we
      shall cause to die, and the others with their arms raised will be for the
      persons from whom you would fain have love and favour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This one,&rdquo; said the Proctor, &ldquo;shall be for the King by whom I would fain

     13  This refers to the superstitious practice called
     <i>envoûtement</i>, which, according to M. Léon de Laborde, was
     well known in France in 1316, and subsisted until the
     sixteenth century. In 1330 the famous Robert d&rsquo;Artois, upon
     retiring to Brabant, occupied himself with pricking waxen
     images which represented King Philip VI., his brother-in-
     law, and the Queen, his sister. (<i>Mémoires de l&rsquo;Académie des
     Inscriptions</i>, vol. xv. p. 426.) During the League the
     enemies of Henri III. and the King of Navarre revived this
     practice.&mdash;(L.) It would appear also from a document in the
     Harley MSS. (18,452, Bib. N&rsquo;at., Paris) that Cosmo Ruggieri,
     the Florentine astrologer, Catherine de&rsquo; Medici&rsquo;s
     confidential adviser, was accused in 1574 of having made a
     wax figure in view of casting a spell upon Charles IX.&mdash;M.

     14  John Brinon, Councillor of the King, President of the
     Parliament of Rouen, Chancellor of Alençon and Berry, Lord
     of Villaines (near Dreux), Remy, and Athueuil (near
     Montfort-l&rsquo;Amaury), belonged to an old family of judicial
     functionaries. He was highly esteemed by Margaret, several
     of whose letters are addressed to him, and he was present at
     the signing of her marriage contract with Henry II. of
     Navarre (Génin&rsquo;s <i>Lettres de Marguerite</i>, p. 444). He
     married Pernelle Perdrier, who brought him the lordship of
     Médan, near Poissy, and other important fiefs, which after
     his death she presented to the King. His praises were sung
     by Le Chandelier, the poet; and M. Floquet, in his History
     of the Parliament of Normandy, states that Brinon rendered
     most important services to France as a negotiator in Italy
     in 1521, and in England in 1524. The <i>Journal d&rsquo;un Bourgeois
     de Paris</i> mentions that he died in Paris in 1528, aged
     forty-four, and was buried in the Church of St. Severin.&mdash;L.
     According to La Croix du Maine&rsquo;s <i>Bibliothèque Françoise</i>,
     Brinon was the author of a poem entitled <i>Les Amours de
     Sydire</i>.&mdash;B. J.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The images,&rdquo; said Gallery, &ldquo;must be set under the altar, to hear mass,
      with words that I will presently tell you to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, speaking of those images that had their arms lowered, the Proctor
      said that one should be for Master Gilles du Mesnil, father of the dead
      man, for he knew that as long as the father lived he would not cease to
      pursue him. Moreover, one of the women with their hands hanging down was
      to be for the Duchess of Alençon, sister to the King; for she bore so much
      love to her old servant, Du Mesnil, and had in so many other matters
      become acquainted with the Proctor&rsquo;s wickedness, that except she died he
      could not live. The second woman that had her arms hanging down was his
      own wife, who was the cause of all his misfortune, and who he felt sure
      would never amend her evil life.
    </p>
    <p>
      When his wife, who could see everything through the keyhole, heard him
      placing her among the dead, she resolved to send him among them first. On
      pretence of going to borrow some money, she went to an uncle she had,
      named Neaufle, who was Master of Requests to the Duke of Alençon, and
      informed him of what she had seen and heard. Neaufle, like the old and
      worthy servant that he was, went forthwith to the Chancellor of Alençon
      and told him the whole story.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the Duke and Duchess of Alençon were not at Court that day, the
      Chancellor related this strange business to the Regent,(15) mother of the
      King and the Duchess, and she sent in all haste for the Provost of
      Paris,(16) who made such speed that he at once seized the Proctor and his
      sorcerer, Gallery. Without constraint or torture they freely confessed
      their guilt, and their case was made out and laid before the King.

      Certain persons, wishing to save their lives, told him that they had only
      sought his good graces by their enchantments; but the King, holding his
      sister&rsquo;s life as dear as his own, commanded that the same sentence should
      be passed on them as if they had made an attempt on his own person.

    <p>
      However, his sister, the Duchess of Alençon, entreated that the Proctor&rsquo;s
      life might be spared, and the sentence of death be commuted to some heavy
      punishment. This request was granted her, and St. Aignan and Gallery were
      sent to the galleys of St. Blancart at Marseilles,(17) where they ended
      their days in close captivity, and had leisure to ponder on the
      grievousness of their crimes. The wicked wife, in the absence of her
      husband, continued in her sinful ways even more than before, and at last
      died in wretchedness.

      &ldquo;I pray you, ladies, consider what evil is caused by a wicked woman, and
      how many evils sprang from the sins of the one I have spoken of. You will
      find that ever since Eve caused Adam to sin, all women have set themselves
      to bring about the torment, slaughter and damnation of men. For myself, I
      have had such experience of their cruelty that I expect to die and be
      damned simply by reason of the despair into which one of them has cast me.
      And yet so great a fool am I, that I cannot but confess that hell coming
      from her hand is more pleasing than Paradise would be from the hand of
      another.&rdquo;

    <p>
      Parlamente, pretending she did not understand that it was touching herself
      he spoke in this fashion, said to him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since hell is as pleasant as you say, you ought not to fear the devil who
      has placed you in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If my devil were to become as black as he has been cruel to me,&rdquo; answered
      Simontault angrily, &ldquo;he would cause the present company as much fright as
      I find pleasure in looking upon them; but the fires of love make me forget
      those of this hell. However, to speak no further concerning this matter, I
      give my vote to Madame Oisille to tell the second story. I feel sure she
      would support my opinion if she were willing to say what she knows about
      women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Forthwith all the company turned towards Oisille, and begged of her to
      proceed, to which she consented, and, laughing, began as follows&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me, ladies, that he who has given me his vote has spoken so
      ill of our sex in his true story of a wicked woman, that I must call to
      mind all the years of my long life to find one whose virtue will suffice
      to gainsay his evil opinion. However, as I have bethought me of one worthy
      to be remembered, I will now relate her history to you.&rdquo;

      <i>TALE II.</i>
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>The wife of a muleteer of Amboise chose rather to die
     cruelly at the hands of her servant than to fall in with his
     wicked purpose</i>.(1)
</pre>
    <p>
      In the town of Amboise there was a muleteer in the service of the Queen of
      Navarre, sister to King Francis, first of that name. She being at Blois,
      where she had been brought to bed of a son, the aforesaid muleteer went
      thither to receive his quarterly payment, whilst his wife remained at
      Amboise in a lodging beyond the bridges.(2)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  The incidents of this story probably took place at
     Amboise, subsequent, however, to the month of August 1530,
     when Margaret was confined of her son John.&mdash;L.

     2  Amboise is on the left bank of the Loire, and there have
     never been any buildings on the opposite bank.    However,
     the bridge over the river intersects the island of St. Jean,
     which is covered with houses, and here the muleteer&rsquo;s wife
     evidently resided.&mdash;M.
</pre>
    <p>
      Now it happened that one of her husband&rsquo;s servants had long loved her
      exceedingly, and one day he could not refrain from speaking of it to her.
      She, however, being a truly virtuous woman, rebuked him so severely,
      threatening to have him beaten and dismissed by her husband, that from
      that time forth he did not venture to speak to her in any such way again
      or to let his love be seen, but kept the fire hidden within his breast
      until the day when his master had gone from home and his mistress was at
      vespers at St. Florentin,(3) the castle church, a long way from the
      muleteer&rsquo;s house.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     3 The Church of St. Florentin here mentioned must not be
     confounded with that of the same name near one of the gates
     of Amboise. Erected in the tenth century by Foulques Nera of
     Anjou, it was a collegiate church, and was attended by the
     townsfolk, although it stood within the precincts of the
     château. For this reason Queen Margaret calls it the castle
     church.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      Whilst he was alone the fancy took him that he might obtain by force what
      neither prayer nor service had availed to procure him, and accordingly he
      broke through a wooden partition which was between the chamber where his
      mistress slept and his own. The curtains of his master&rsquo;s bed on the one
      side and of the servant&rsquo;s bed on the other so covered the walls as to hide
      the opening he had made; and thus his wickedness was not perceived until
      his mistress was in bed, together with a little girl eleven or twelve
      years old.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the poor woman was in her first sleep, the servant, in his shirt and
      with his naked sword in his hand, came through the opening he had made in
      the wall into her bed; but as soon as she felt him beside her, she leaped
      out, addressing to him all such reproaches as a virtuous woman might
      utter. His love, however, was but bestial, and he would have better
      understood the language of his mules than her honourable reasonings;
      indeed, he showed himself even more bestial than the beasts with whom he
      had long consorted. Finding she ran so quickly round a table that he could
      not catch her, and that she was strong enough to break away from him
      twice, he despaired of ravishing her alive, and dealt her a terrible
      sword-thrust in the loins, thinking that, if fear and force had not
      brought her to yield, pain would assuredly do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      The contrary, however, happened, for just as a good soldier, on seeing his
      own blood, is the more fired to take vengeance on his enemies and win
      renown, so her chaste heart gathered new strength as she ran fleeing from
      the hands of the miscreant, saying to him the while all she could think of
      to bring him to see his guilt. But so filled was he with rage that he paid
      no heed to her words. He dealt her several more thrusts, to avoid which
      she continued running as long as her legs could carry her.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, after great loss of blood, she felt that death was near, she lifted
      her eyes to heaven, clasped her hands and gave thanks to God, calling Him
      her strength, her patience, and her virtue, and praying Him to accept her
      blood which had been shed for the keeping of His commandment and in
      reverence of His Son, through whom she firmly believed all her sins to be
      washed away and blotted out from the remembrance of His wrath.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she was uttering the words, &ldquo;Lord, receive the soul that has been
      redeemed by Thy goodness,&rdquo; she fell upon her face to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the miscreant dealt her several thrusts, and when she had lost both
      power of speech and strength of body, and was no longer able to make any
      defence, he ravished her.(4)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     4 Brantôme, in his account of Mary Queen of Scots, quotes
     this story. After mentioning that the headsman remained
     alone with the Queen&rsquo;s decapitated corpse, he adds: &ldquo;He then
     took off her shoes and handled her as he pleased. It is
     suspected that he treated her in the same way as that
     miserable muleteer, in the Hundred Stories of the Queen of
     Navarre, treated the poor woman he killed. Stranger
     temptations than this come to men. After he (the
     executioner) had done as he chose, the (Queen&rsquo;s) body was
     carried into a room adjoining that of her servants.&rdquo;
      Lalanne&rsquo;s <i>OEuvres de Brantôme</i>, vol. vii. p. 438.&mdash;M.
</pre>
    <p>
      Having thus satisfied his wicked lust, he fled in haste, and in spite of
      all pursuit was never seen again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little girl, who was in bed with the muleteer&rsquo;s wife, had hidden
      herself under the bed in her fear; but on seeing that the man was gone,
      she came to her mistress. Finding her to be without speech or movement,
      she called to the neighbours from the window for aid; and as they loved
      and esteemed her mistress as much as any woman that belonged to the town,
      they came forthwith, bringing surgeons with them. The latter found that
      she had received twenty-five mortal wounds in her body, and although they
      did what they could to help her, it was all in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless she lingered for an hour longer without speaking, yet making
      signs with eye and hand to show that she had not lost her understanding.
      Being asked by a priest in what faith she died, she answered, by signs as
      plain as any speech, that she placed her hope of salvation in Jesus Christ
      alone; and so with glad countenance and eyes upraised to heaven her chaste
      body yielded up its soul to its Creator.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as the corpse, having been laid out and shrouded,(5) was placed at
      the door to await the burial company, the poor husband arrived and beheld
      his wife&rsquo;s body in front of his house before he had even received tidings
      of her death. He inquired the cause of this, and found that he had double
      occasion to grieve; and his grief was indeed so great that it nearly
      killed him.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     5 Common people were then buried in shrouds, not in coffins.
     &mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      This martyr of chastity was buried in the Church of St. Florentin, and, as
      was their duty, all the upright women of Amboise failed not to show her
      every possible honour, deeming themselves fortunate in belonging to a town
      where so virtuous a woman had been found. And seeing the honour that was
      shown to the deceased, such women as were wanton and unchaste resolved to
      amend their lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This, ladies, is a true story, which should incline us more strongly to
      preserve the fair virtue of chastity. We who are of gentle blood should
      die of shame on feeling in our hearts that worldly lust to avoid which the
      poor wife of a muleteer shrank not from so cruel a death. Some esteem
      themselves virtuous women who have never like this one resisted unto the
      shedding of blood. It is fitting that we should humble ourselves, for God
      does not vouchsafe His grace to men because of their birth or riches, but
      according as it pleases His own good-will. He pays no regard to persons,
      but chooses according to His purpose; and he whom He chooses He honours
      with all virtues. And often He chooses the lowly to confound those whom
      the world exalts and honours; for, as He Himself hath told us, &lsquo;Let us not
      rejoice in our merits, but rather because our names are written in the
      Book of Life, from which nor death, nor hell, nor sin can blot them out.&rsquo;&rdquo;
       (6)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     6  These are not the exact words of Scripture, but a
     combination of several passages from the Book of
     Revelation.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      There was not a lady in the company but had tears of compassion in her
      eyes for the pitiful and glorious death of the muleteer&rsquo;s wife. Each
      thought within herself that, should fortune serve her in the same way, she
      would strive to imitate this poor woman in her martyrdom. Oisille,
      however, perceiving that time was being lost in praising the dead woman,
      said to Saffredent&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless you can tell us something that will make the company laugh, I
      think none of them will forgive me for the fault I have committed in
      making them weep; wherefore I give you my vote for your telling of the
      third story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Saffredent, who would gladly have recounted something agreeable to the
      company, and above all to one amongst the ladies, said that it was not for
      him to speak, seeing that there were others older and better instructed
      than himself, who should of right come first. Nevertheless, since the lot
      had fallen upon himself, he would rather have done with it at once, for
      the more numerous the good speakers before him, the worse would his own
      tale appear.

      <i>TALE III.</i>
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>The Queen of Naples, being wronged by King Alfonso, her
     husband, revenged herself with a gentleman whose wife was
     the King&rsquo;s mistress; and this intercourse lasted all their
     lives without the King at any time having suspicion of
     it</i>.(1)
</pre>
    <p>
      I have often desired, ladies, to be a sharer in the good fortune of the
      man whose story I am about to relate to you. You must know that in the
      time of King Alfonso,(2) whose lust was the sceptre of his kingdom,(3)
      there lived in the town of Naples a gentleman, so honourable, comely, and
      pleasant that his perfections induced an old gentleman to give him his
      daughter in marriage.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  This story is historical. The events occurred at Naples
     cir. 1450.&mdash;L.

     2  The King spoken of in this story must be Alfonso V., King
     of Aragon, who was born in 1385, and succeeded his father,
     Ferdinand the Just, in 1416. He had already made various
     expeditions to Sardinia and Corsica, when, in 1421, Jane II.
     of Naples begged of him to assist her in her contest against
     Louis of Anjou. Alfonso set sail for Italy as requested, but
     speedily quarrelled with Jane, on account of the manner in
     which he treated her lover, the Grand Seneschal Caraccioli.
     Jane, at her death in 1438, bequeathed her crown to René,
     brother of Louis of Anjou, whose claims Alfonso immediately
     opposed. Whilst blockading Gaëta he was defeated and
     captured, but ultimately set at liberty, whereupon he
     resumed the war. In 1442 he at last secured possession of
     Naples, and compelled René to withdraw from Italy. From that
     time Alfonso never returned to Spain, but settling himself
     in his Italian dominions, assumed the title of King of the
     Two Sicilies. He obtained the surname of the Magnanimous,
     from his generous conduct towards some conspirators, a list
     of whose names he tore to pieces unread, saying, &ldquo;I will
     show these noblemen that I have more concern for their lives
     than they have themselves.&rdquo; The surname of the Learned was
     afterwards given to him from the circumstance that, like his
     rival René of Anjou, he personally cultivated letters, and
     also protected many of the leading learned men of Italy.
     Alfonso was fond of strolling about the streets of Naples
     unattended, and one day, when he was cautioned respecting
     this habit, he replied, &ldquo;A father who walks abroad in the
     midst of his children has no cause for fear.&rdquo; Whilst
     possessed of many remarkable qualities, Alfonso, as Muratori
     and other writers have shown, was of an extremely licentious
     disposition. That he had no belief in conjugal fidelity is
     evidenced by his saying that &ldquo;to ensure domestic happiness
     the husband should be deaf and the wife blind.&rdquo; He himself
     had several mistresses, and lived at variance with his wife,
     respecting whom some particulars are given in a note on page
     69. He died in 1458, at the age of seventy-four, bequeathing
     his Italian possessions to Ferdinand, Duke of Calabria, his
     natural son by a Spanish beauty named Margaret de Hijar. It
     may be added that Brantôme makes a passing allusion to this
     tale of the <i>Heptameron</i> in his <i>Vies des Dames Galantes</i>
     (Disc, i.), styling it &ldquo;a very fine one.&rdquo;&mdash;L. and Ed.

     3 Meaning that he  employed his  sovereign authority for the
     accomplishment of his amorous desires.&mdash;M.
</pre>
    <p>
      She vied with her husband in grace and comeliness, and there was great
      love between them, until a certain day in Carnival time, when the King
      went masked from house to house. All strove to give him the best welcome
      they could, but when he came to this gentleman&rsquo;s house he was entertained
      better than anywhere else, what with sweetmeats, and singers, and music,
      and, further, the fairest woman that, to his thinking, he had ever seen.
      At the end of the feast she sang a song with her husband in so graceful a
      fashion that she seemed more beautiful than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King, perceiving so many perfections united in one person, was not
      over pleased at the gentle harmony between the husband and wife, and
      deliberated how he might destroy it. The chief difficulty he met with was
      in the great affection which he observed existed between them, and on this
      account he hid his passion in his heart as deeply as he could. To relieve
      it in some measure, he gave many entertainments to the lords and ladies of
      Naples, and at these the gentleman and his wife were not forgotten. Now,
      inasmuch as men willingly believe what they desire, it seemed to the King
      that the glances of this lady gave him fair promise of future happiness,
      if only she were not restrained by her husband&rsquo;s presence. Accordingly,
      that he might learn whether his surmise was true, the King intrusted a
      commission to the husband, and sent him on a journey to Rome for a
      fortnight or three weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the gentleman was gone, his wife, who had never before been
      separated from him, was in great distress; but the King comforted her as
      often as he was able, with gentle persuasions and presents, so that at
      last she was not only consoled, but well pleased with her husband&rsquo;s
      absence. Before the three weeks were over at the end of which he was to be
      home again, she had come to be so deeply in love with the King that her
      husband&rsquo;s return was no less displeasing to her than his departure had
      been. Not wishing to be deprived of the King&rsquo;s society, she agreed with
      him that whenever her husband went to his country-house she would give him
      notice of it. He might then visit her in safety, and with such secrecy
      that her honour, which she regarded more than her conscience, would not
      suffer.(4)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     4 The edition of 1558 is here followed, the MSS. being
     rather obscure.&mdash;M.
</pre>
    <p>
      Having this hope, the lady continued of very cheerful mind, and when her
      husband arrived she welcomed him so heartily that, even had he been told
      that the King had sought her in his absence, he would have had no
      suspicion. In course of time, however, the flame, that is so difficult of
      concealment, began to show itself, and the husband, having a strong
      inkling of the truth, kept good watch, by which means he was well-nigh
      convinced. Nevertheless, as he feared that the man who wronged him would
      treat him still worse if he appeared to notice it, he resolved to
      dissemble, holding it better to live in trouble than to risk his life for
      a woman who had ceased to love him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his vexation of spirit, however, he resolved, if he could, to retort
      upon the King, and knowing that women, especially such as are of lofty and
      honourable minds, are more moved by resentment than by love, he made bold
      one day while speaking with the Queen (5) to tell her that it moved his
      pity to see her so little loved by the King.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     5 This was Mary (daughter of Henry III. of Castile), who was
     married to King Alfonso at Valencia on June 29, 1415. Juan
     de Mariana, the Spanish historian, records that the ceremony
     was celebrated with signal pomp by the schismatical Pope
     Benedict XIII. The bride brought her husband a dowry of
     200,000 ducats, and also various territorial possessions.
     The marriage, however, was not a happy one, on account of
     Alfonso&rsquo;s licentious disposition, and the Queen is said to
     have strangled one of his mistresses, Margaret de Hijar, in
     a fit of jealousy. Alfonso, to escape from his wife&rsquo;s
     interference, turned his attention to foreign expeditions.
     According to the authors of <i>L&rsquo;Art de Vérifier les Dates</i>,
     Queen Mary never once set foot in Italy, and this statement
     is borne out by Mariana, who shows that whilst Alfonso was
     reigning in Naples his wife governed the kingdom of Aragon,
     making war and signing truces and treaties of peace with
     Castile. In the <i>Heptameron</i>, therefore, Margaret departs
     from historical accuracy when she represents the Queen as
     residing at Naples with her husband. Moreover, judging by
     the date of Mary&rsquo;s marriage, she could no longer have been
     young when Alfonso secured the Neapolitan throne. It is to
     be presumed that the Queen of Navarre designedly changed the
     date of her story, and that the incidents referred to really
     occurred in Spain prior to Alfonso&rsquo;s departure for Italy.
     There is no mention of Mary in her husband&rsquo;s will, a
     remarkable document which is still extant. A letter written
     to her by Pope Calixtus II. shows that late in life the King
     was desirous of repudiating her to marry an Italian mistress
     named Lucretia Alania. The latter repaired to Rome to
     negotiate the affair, but the Pope refused to treat with
     her, and wrote to Mary saying that she must be prudent, but
     that he would not dissolve the marriage, lest God should
     punish him for participating in so great a crime. Mary died
     a few months after her husband in 1458, and was buried in a
     convent at Valencia.&mdash;L. and Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      The Queen, who had heard of the affection that existed between the King
      and the gentleman&rsquo;s wife, replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot have both honour and pleasure together. I well know that I have
      the honour whilst another has the pleasure; and in the same way she who
      has the pleasure has not the honour that is mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon the gentleman, who understood full well at whom these words were
      aimed, replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam, honour is inborn with you, for your lineage is such that no title,
      whether of queen or empress, could be an increase of nobility; yet your
      beauty, grace, and virtue are well deserving of pleasure, and she who robs
      you of what is yours does a greater wrong to herself than to you, seeing
      that for a glory which is turned to her shame, she loses as much pleasure
      as you or any lady in the realm could enjoy. I can truly tell you, madam,
      that were the King to lay aside his crown, he would not possess any
      advantage over me in satisfying a lady; nay, I am sure that to content one
      so worthy as yourself he would indeed be pleased to change his temperament
      for mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Queen laughed and replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The King may be of a less vigorous temperament than you, yet the love he
      bears me contents me well, and I prefer it to any other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said the gentleman, &ldquo;if that were so, I should have no pity for
      you. I feel sure that you would be well pleased if the like of your own
      virtuous love were found in the King&rsquo;s heart; but God has withheld this
      from you in order that, not finding what you desire in your husband, you
      may not make him your god on earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I confess to you,&rdquo; said the Queen, &ldquo;that the love I bear him is so great
      that the like could not be found in any other heart but mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, madam,&rdquo; said the gentleman; &ldquo;you have not fathomed the love of
      every heart. I will be so bold as to tell you that you are loved by one
      whose love is so great and measureless that your own is as nothing beside
      it. The more he perceives that the King&rsquo;s love fails you, the more does
      his own wax and increase, in such wise that, were it your pleasure, you
      might be recompensed for all you have lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Queen began to perceive, both from these words and from the
      gentleman&rsquo;s countenance, that what he said came from the depth of his
      heart. She remembered also that for a long time he had so zealously sought
      to do her service that he had fallen into sadness. She had hitherto deemed
      this to be on account of his wife, but now she was firmly of belief that
      it was for love of herself. Moreover, the very quality of love, which
      compels itself to be recognised when it is unfeigned, made her feel
      certain of what had been hidden from every one. As she looked at the
      gentleman, who was far more worthy of being loved than her husband, she
      reflected that he was forsaken by his wife, as she herself was by the
      King; and then, beset by vexation and jealousy against her husband, as
      well as moved by the love of the gentleman, she began with sighs and
      tearful eyes to say&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah me! shall revenge prevail with me where love has been of no avail?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman, who understood what these words meant, replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vengeance, madam, is sweet when in place of slaying an enemy it gives
      life to a true lover.(6) Methinks it is time that truth should cause you
      to abandon the foolish love you bear to one who loves you not, and that a
      just and reasonable love should banish fear, which cannot dwell in a noble
      and virtuous heart. Come, madam, let us set aside the greatness of your
      station and consider that, of all men and women in the world, we are the
      most deceived, betrayed, and bemocked by those whom we have most truly
      loved. Let us avenge ourselves, madam, not so much to requite them in the
      way they deserve as to satisfy that love which, for my own part, I cannot
      continue to endure and live. And I think that, unless your heart be harder
      than flint or diamond, you cannot but feel some spark from the fires which
      only increase the more I seek to conceal them. If pity for me, who am
      dying of love for you, does not move you to love me, at least pity for
      yourself should do so. You are so perfect that you deserve to win the
      heart of every honourable man in the world, yet you are contemned and
      forsaken by him for whose sake you have scorned all others.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     6 The above sentence being omitted in the MS. followed in
     this edition, it has been supplied from MS. No. 1520 in the
     Bibliothèque Nationale.&mdash;L.
</pre>
    <p>
      On hearing these words the Queen was so greatly moved that, for fear of
      showing in her countenance the trouble of her mind, she took the
      gentleman&rsquo;s arm and went forth into a garden that was close to her
      apartment. There she walked to and fro for a long time without being able
      to say a word to him. The gentleman saw that she was half won, and when
      they were at the end of the path, where none could see them, he made a
      very full declaration of the love which he had so long hidden from her.
      They found that they were of one mind in the matter, and enacted (7) the
      vengeance which they were no longer able to forego. Moreover, they there
      agreed that whenever the husband went into the country, and the King left
      the castle to visit the wife in the town, the gentleman should always
      return and come to the castle to see the Queen. Thus, the deceivers being
      themselves deceived, all four would share in the pleasures that two of
      them had thought to keep to themselves.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     7 This expression has allusion to the mysteries or religious
     plays so frequently performed in the fifteenth and sixteenth
     centuries. The Mystery of Vengeance, which depicted the
     misfortunes which fell upon those who had taken part in the
     crucifixion of Jesus Christ, such as Pontius Pilate, &amp;c, and
     ended by the capture and destruction of Jerusalem, properly
     came after the Mysteries of the Passion and the
     Resurrection.&mdash;L.
</pre>
    <p>
      When the agreement had been made, the Queen returned to her apartment and
      the gentleman to his house, both being so well pleased that they had
      forgotten all their former troubles. The jealousy they had previously felt
      at the King&rsquo;s visits to the lady was now changed to desire, so that the
      gentleman went oftener than usual to his house in the country, which was
      only half a league distant. As soon as the King was advised of his
      departure, he never failed to go and see the lady; and the gentleman, when
      night was come, betook himself to the castle to the Queen, where he did
      duty as the King&rsquo;s lieutenant, and so secretly that none ever discovered
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This manner of life lasted for a long time; but as the King was a person
      of public condition, he could not conceal his love sufficiently well to
      prevent it from coming at length to the knowledge of every one; and all
      honourable people felt great pity for the gentleman, though divers
      malicious youths were wont to deride him by making horns at him behind his
      back. But he knew of their derision, and it gave him great pleasure, so
      that he came to think as highly of his horns as of the King&rsquo;s crown.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, however, the King and the gentleman&rsquo;s wife, noticing a stag&rsquo;s
      head that was set up in the gentleman&rsquo;s house, could not refrain in his
      presence from laughing and saying that the head was suited to the house.
      Soon afterwards the gentleman, who was no less spirited than the King,
      caused the following words to be written over the stag&rsquo;s head:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Io porto le corna, ciascun lo vede, Ma tal le porta che no lo
          crede.&rdquo; (8)
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     8 &ldquo;All men may see the horns I&rsquo;ve got, But one wears horns
     and knows it not.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      When the King came again to the house, he observed these lines newly
      written, and inquired their meaning of the gentleman, who said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the King&rsquo;s secret be hidden from the subject, it is not fitting that
      the subject&rsquo;s secret should be revealed to the King. Be content with
      knowing that those who wear horns do not always have their caps raised
      from their heads. Some horns are so soft that they never uncap one, and
      especially are they light to him who thinks he has them not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The King perceived by these words that the gentleman knew something of his
      own behaviour, but he never had any suspicion of the love between him and
      the Queen; for the more pleased the latter was with the life led by her
      husband, the more did she feign to be distressed by it. And so on either
      side they lived in this love, until at last old age took them in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, ladies, is a story by which you may be guided, for, as I willingly
      confess, it shows you that when your husbands give you bucks&rsquo; horns you
      can give them stags&rsquo; horns in return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am quite sure, Saffredent,&rdquo; began Ennasuite laughing, &ldquo;that if you
      still love as ardently as you were formerly wont to do, you would submit
      to horns as big as oak-trees if only you might repay them as you pleased.
      However, now that your hair is growing grey, it is time to leave your
      desires in peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fair lady,&rdquo; said Saffredent, &ldquo;though I be robbed of hope by the woman I
      love, and of ardour by old age, yet it lies not in my power to weaken my
      inclination. Since you have rebuked me for so honourable a desire, I give
      you my vote for the telling of the fourth tale, that we may see whether
      you can bring forward some example to refute me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During this converse one of the ladies fell to laughing heartily, knowing
      that she who took Saffredent&rsquo;s words to herself was not so loved by him
      that he would have suffered horns, shame, or wrong for her sake. When
      Saffredent perceived that the lady who laughed understood him, he was well
      satisfied and became silent, so that Ennasuite might begin; which she did
      as follows&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In order, ladies, that Saffredent and the rest of the company may know
      that all ladies are not like the Queen he has spoken of, and that all
      foolhardy and venturesome men do not compass their ends, I will tell you a
      story in which I will acquaint you with the opinion of a lady who deemed
      the vexation of failure in love to be harder of endurance than death
      itself. However, I shall give no names, because the events are so fresh in
      people&rsquo;s minds that I should fear to offend some who are near of kin.&rdquo;

      <i>TALE IV</i>.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>A young gentleman sought to discover whether the offer of
     an honour-able love would be displeasing to his master&rsquo;s
     sister, a lady of the most illustrious lineage in Flanders,
     who had been twice widowed, and was a woman of muck spirit.
     Meeting with a reply contrary to his desires, he attempted
     to possess her by force; but she resisted him successfully,
     and by the advice of her lady of honour, without seeming to
     take notice of his designs and efforts, gradually ceased to
     regard him with the favour with which she had been wont to
     treat him. Thus, by his foolhardy presumption, he lost the
     honourable and habitual companionship which, more than
     others, he had had with her</i>.(1)

     1 This story is historical, and the incidents must have
     occurred between 1520 and 1525.&mdash;L.
</pre>
    <p>
      There lived in the land of Flanders a lady of such high lineage, that none
      more illustrious could be found. She was a widow, both her first and
      second husbands being dead, and she had no children living. During her
      widowhood she lived in retirement with her brother, by whom she was
      greatly loved, and who was a very great lord and married to the daughter
      of a King. This young Prince was a man much given to pleasure, fond of
      hunting, pastimes, and women, as his youth inclined him. He had a wife,
      however, who was of a very froward disposition, (2) and found no pleasure
      in her husband&rsquo;s pursuits; wherefore this Lord always took his sister
      along with his wife, for she was a most joyous and pleasant companion, and
      withal a discreet and honourable woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this Lord&rsquo;s household there was a gentleman who, for stature,
      comeliness, and grace, surpassed all his fellows. This gentleman, (3)
      perceiving that his master&rsquo;s sister was of merry mood and always ready for
      a laugh, was minded to try whether the offer of an honourable love would
      be displeasing to her.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     2  The young prince here mentioned is Francis I., who at
     this period was between twenty-five and thirty years old.
     The froward wife is Claude of France (daughter of Louis XII.
     and Anne of Brittany), whom Francis married in 1514, and who
     died of consumption at Blois ten years later, while the King
     was on his way to conquer Milan. (See the Memoir of
     Margaret, pp. xxvi. and xxxv.)&mdash;Ed.

     3  According to Brantôme, the Lady of Flanders, the young
     Prince&rsquo;s sister, was Queen Margaret herself, and the
     gentleman who paid court to her was William Gouffier, Lord
     of Bonnivet, of Crevecoeur, Thois, and Querdes, and also a
     favourite of Francis I., with whom he was brought up, and by
     whom he was employed in all the great enterprises of the
     time. Bonnivet became Admiral of France in 1517, and two
     years later he was created governor of Dauphiné, and
     guardian of the Dauphin&rsquo;s person. He negotiated the peace
     and alliance with Henry VIII., and arranged all the
     preliminaries of the interview known as the Field of the
     Cloth of Gold (1520). In 1521, says Anselme in his <i>Histoire
     Généalogique</i>, Bonnivet became governor of Guienne,
     commanded the army sent to Navarre, and captured Fontarabia.
     In 1524 he was despatched to Italy as lieutenant-general,
     and besieged Milan, but was repeatedly repulsed, and finally
     fell back on the Ticino. He was killed at Pavia (February
     24, 1525), and was largely responsible for that disastrous
     defeat, having urged Francis I. to give battle, contrary to
     the advice of the more experienced captains. Bonnivet, as
     mentioned by Queen Margaret in this story, had the
     reputation of being one of the handsomest men of his time.&mdash;
     L.
</pre>
    <p>
      He made this offer, but the answer that he received from her was contrary
      to his desires. However, although her reply was such as beseemed a
      Princess and a woman of true virtue, she readily pardoned his hardihood
      for the sake of his comeliness and breeding, and let him know that she
      bore him no ill-will for what he had said. But she charged him never to
      speak to her after that fashion again; and this he promised, that he might
      not lose the pleasure and honour of her conversation. Nevertheless, as
      time went on, his love so increased that he forgot the promise he had
      made. He did not, however, risk further trial of words, for he had learned
      by experience, and much against his will, what virtuous replies she was
      able to make. But he reflected that if he could take her somewhere at a
      disadvantage, she, being a widow, young, lusty, and of a lively humour,
      would perchance take pity on him and on herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      To compass his ends, he told his master that excellent hunting was to be
      had in the neighbourhood of his house, and that if it pleased him to
      repair thither and hunt three or four stags in the month of May, he could
      have no finer sport. The Lord granted the gentleman&rsquo;s request, as much for
      the affection he bore him as for the pleasure of the chase, and repaired
      to his house, which was as handsome and as fairly ordered as that of the
      richest gentleman in the land.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lord and his Lady were lodged on one side of the house, and she whom
      the gentleman loved more than himself on the other. Her apartment was so
      well arranged, tapestried above and matted below,(4) that it was
      impossible to perceive a trap-door which was by the side of her bed, and
      which opened into a room beneath, that was occupied by the gentleman&rsquo;s
      mother.(5)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     4  In most palaces and castles at this period the walls were
     covered with tapestry and the floors with matting. This
     remark is necessary to enable one to understand Bonnivet&rsquo;s
     stratagem.&mdash;D.

     5  Philippa de Montmorency, second wife of William Gouffier,
     Lord of Boissy, who was Bonnivet&rsquo;s father (Anselme&rsquo;s
     <i>Histoire Généalogique</i>, vol. vii. p. 880).&mdash;L.
</pre>
    <p>
      She being an old lady, somewhat troubled by rheum, and fearful lest the
      cough she had should disturb the Princess, made exchange of chambers with
      her son. In the evening this old lady was wont to bring sweetmeats to the
      Princess for her collation,(6) at which the gentleman was present; and
      being greatly beloved by her brother and intimate with him, he was also
      suffered to be present when she rose in the morning and when she retired
      to bed, on which occasions he always found reasons for an increase of his
      affection.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     6 At that period the collation, as the supper was called,
     was served at seven in the evening, shortly before the
     curfew.&mdash;B. J.
</pre>
    <p>
      Thus it came to pass that one evening he made the Princess stay up very
      late, until at last, being desirous of sleep, she bade him leave her. He
      then went to his own room, and there put on the handsomest and
      best-scented shirt he had, and a nightcap so well adorned that nothing was
      lacking in it. It seemed, to him, as he looked at himself in his mirror,
      that no lady in the world could deny herself to one of his comeliness and
      grace. He therefore promised himself a happy issue to his enterprise, and
      so lay down on his bed, where in his desire and sure hope of exchanging it
      for one more honourable and pleasant, he looked to make no very long stay.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as he had dismissed all his attendants he rose to fasten the door
      after them; and for a long time he listened to hear whether there were any
      sound in the room of the Princess, which was above his own. When he had
      made sure that all was quiet, he wished to begin his pleasant task, and
      little by little let down the trap-door, which was so excellently wrought,
      and so well covered with cloth, that it made not the least noise. Then he
      ascended into the room and came to the bedside of his lady, who was just
      falling asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Forthwith, having no regard for the duty that he owed his mistress or for
      the house to which she belonged, he got into bed with her, without
      entreating her permission or making any kind of ceremony. She felt him in
      her arms before she knew that he had entered the room; but being strong,
      she freed herself from his grasp, and fell to striking, biting, and
      scratching him, demanding the while to know who he was, so that for fear
      lest she should call out he sought to stop her mouth with the bedclothes.
      But this he found it impossible to do, for when she saw that he was using
      all his strength to work her shame she did as much to baffle him. She
      further called as loudly as she could to her lady of honour,(7) who slept
      in her room; and this old and virtuous woman ran to her mistress in her
      nightdress.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     7 The lady in question was Blanche de Tournon, daughter of
     James de Tournon, by Jane de Polignac, and sister of
     Cardinal de Tournon, Minister of Francis I. She first
     married Raymond d&rsquo;Agout,  Baron of Sault in Provence, who
     died in 1503;  and secondly James de Chastillon, Chamberlain
     to Charles VIII. and Louis XII., killed at the siege of
     Ravenna in 1512. Brantôme states, moreover, that she
     subsequently married Cardinal John du Bellay. (See Appendix
     to the&rsquo;present volume, C.) In this story, Margaret describes
     the Princess of Flanders as having lost two husbands, with
     the view of disguising the identity of her heroine. Her own
     husband (the Duke of Alençon) was still alive; but Madame de
     Chastillon had twice become a widow, and the Queen, who was
     well aware of this, designedly ascribed to the Princess the
     situation of the lady of honour. This story should be
     compared with the poem &ldquo;Quatre Dames et Quatre
     Gentilhommes&rdquo; in the <i>Marguerites de la Marguerite</i>.&mdash;F.
</pre>
    <p>
      When the gentleman saw that he was discovered, he was so fearful of being
      recognised by the lady, that he descended in all haste through his
      trap-door; his despair at returning in such an evil plight being no less
      than his desire and assurance of a gracious reception had previously been.
      He found his mirror and candle on his table,(8) and looking at his face,
      all bleeding from the lady&rsquo;s scratches and bites, whence the blood was
      trickling over his fine shirt, which had now more blood than gold (9)
      about it, he said&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     8  It is not surprising that the mirror should have been
     lying on the table. Mirrors were for a long time no larger
     than our modern hand-glasses. That of Mary de&rsquo; Medici,
     offered to her by the Republic of Venice, and now in the
     Galerie d&rsquo;Apollon at the Louvre, is extremely small, though
     it has an elaborate frame enriched with precious cameos.
     Even the mirrors placed by Louis XIV. in the celebrated
     Galerie des Glaces at Versailles were no larger than
     ordinary window-panes.&mdash;M.

     9  Shirts were then adorned at the collar and in front with
     gold-thread embroidery, such as is shown in some of Clouet&rsquo;s
     portraits. In M. de Laborde&rsquo;s <i>Comptes des Bâtiments du Roi
     au XVIème Siècle</i> (vol. ii.) mention is made of &ldquo;a shirt
     with gold work,&rdquo; &ldquo;a shirt with white work,&rdquo; &amp;c.; and also of
     two beautiful women&rsquo;s chemises in Holland linen &ldquo;richly
     worked with gold thread and silk, at the price of six crowns
     apiece.&rdquo;&mdash;M.

      &ldquo;Beauty! now hast thou been rewarded according to thy deserts. By reason
      of thy vain promises I attempted an impossible undertaking, and one that,
      instead of increasing my happiness, will perchance double my misfortune. I
      feel sure that if she knows I made this foolish attempt contrary to the
      promise I gave her, I shall lose the honourable and accustomed
      companionship which more than any other I have had with her. And my folly
      has well deserved this, for if I was to turn my good looks and grace to
      any account, I ought not to have hidden them in the darkness. I should not
      have sought to take that chaste body by force, but should have waited in
      long service and humble patience till love had conquered her. Without
      love, all man&rsquo;s merits and might are of no avail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus he passed the night in tears, regrets, and sorrowings such as I
      cannot describe; and in the morning, finding his face greatly torn, he
      feigned grievous sickness and to be unable to endure the light, until the
      company had left his house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady, who had come off victorious, knew that there was no man at her
      brother&rsquo;s Court that durst attempt such an enterprise save him who had had
      the boldness to declare his love to her. She therefore concluded that it
      was indeed her host, and made search through the room with her lady of
      honour to discover how he could have entered it. But in this she failed,
      whereupon she said to her companion in great anger&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may be sure that it can have been none other than the lord of this
      house, and I will make such report of him to my brother in the morning
      that his head shall bear witness to my chastity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seeing her in such wrath, the lady of honour said to her&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right glad am I, madam, to find you esteem your honour so highly that, to
      exalt it, you would not spare the life of a man who, for the love he bears
      you, has put it to this risk. But it often happens that one lessens what
      one thinks to increase; wherefore, I pray you, madam, tell me the truth of
      the whole matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the lady had fully related the business, the lady of honour said to
      her&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You assure me that he had nothing from you save only scratches and
      blows?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do assure you that it was so,&rdquo; said the lady; &ldquo;and, unless he find a
      rare surgeon, I am certain his face will bear the marks tomorrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, since it is thus, madam,&rdquo; said the lady of honour, &ldquo;it seems to me
      that you have more reason to thank God than to think of vengeance; for you
      may well believe that, since the gentleman had spirit enough to make such
      an attempt, his grief at having failed will be harder of endurance than
      any death you could award him. If you desire to be revenged on him, let
      love and shame do their work; they will torment him more grievously than
      could you. And if you would speak out for your honour&rsquo;s sake,(10) beware,
      madam, lest you fall into a mishap like to his own.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     10 In Boaistuau&rsquo;s edition this passage runs: &ldquo;Let love and
     shame do their work, they will know better than you how to
     torment him; and do this for your honour&rsquo;s sake.    Beware,&rdquo;
      &amp;c.&mdash;L.
</pre>
    <p>
      He, instead of obtaining the greatest delight he could imagine, has
      encountered the gravest vexation any gentleman could endure. So you,
      madam, thinking to exalt your honour, may perchance diminish it. If you
      make complaint, you will bring to light what is known to none, for you may
      rest assured that the gentleman on his side will never reveal aught of the
      matter. And even if my lord, your brother, should do justice to him at
      your asking, and the poor gentleman should die, yet would it everywhere be
      noised abroad that he had had his will of you, and most people would say
      it was unlikely a gentleman would make such an attempt unless the lady had
      given him great encouragement. You are young and fair; you live gaily with
      all; and there is no one at Court but has seen the kind treatment you have
      shown to the gentleman whom you suspect. Hence every one will believe that
      if he did this deed it was not without some fault on your side; and your
      honour, for which you have never had to blush, will be freely questioned
      wherever the story is related.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On hearing the excellent reasoning of her lady of honour, the Princess
      perceived that she spoke the truth, and that she herself would, with just
      cause, be blamed on account of the close friendship which she had always
      shown towards the gentleman. Accordingly she inquired of her lady of
      honour what she ought to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; replied the other, &ldquo;since you are pleased to receive my counsels,
      having regard for the affection whence they spring, it seems to me you
      should be glad at heart to think that the most comely and gallant
      gentleman I have ever seen was not able, whether by love or by force, to
      turn you from the path of true virtue. For this, madam, you should humble
      yourself before God, and confess that it was not through your own merit,
      for many women who have led straighter lives than you have been humiliated
      by men less worthy of love than he. And you should henceforth be more than
      ever on your guard against proposals of love; for many have the second
      time yielded to dangers which on the first occasion they were able to
      avoid. Be mindful, madam, that love is blind, and that it makes people
      blind in such wise that the way appears safest just when it is most
      slippery. Further, madam, it seems to me that you should give no sign of
      what has befallen you, whether to him or to any one else, and that if he
      seeks to say anything on the matter, you should feign not to understand
      him. In this way you will avoid two dangers, the one of vain-glory in the
      victory you have won, and the other of recalling things so pleasant to the
      flesh that at mention of them the chastest can only with difficulty avoid
      feeling some sparks of the flame, though they strive their utmost to
      escape them. (11)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     11 We here follow MS. No. 1520.&mdash;L.
</pre>
    <p>
      Besides this, madam, in order that he may not think he has done anything
      pleasing in your sight, I am of opinion you should little by little
      withdraw the friendship you have been in the habit of showing him. In this
      way he will know how much you scorn his rashness, and how great is your
      goodness, since, content with the victory that God has given you, you seek
      no further vengeance upon him. And may God give you grace, madam, to
      continue in the virtue He has placed in your heart; and, knowing that all
      good things come from Him, may you love and serve Him better than before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Princess determined to abide by the advice of her lady of honour, and
      then fell asleep with joy as great as was the sadness of her waking lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morrow, the lord, her brother, wishing to depart, inquired for his
      host, and was told that he was too ill to bear the light or to hear any
      one speak. The Prince was greatly astonished at this, and wished to go and
      see the gentleman; however, learning that he was asleep, he would not
      awake him, but left the house without bidding him farewell. He took with
      him his wife and sister, and the latter, hearing the excuses sent by the
      gentleman, who would not see the Prince or any of the company before their
      departure, felt convinced that it was indeed he who had so tormented her,
      and that he durst not let the marks which she had left upon his face be
      seen. And although his master frequently sent for him, he did not return
      to Court until he was quite healed of all his wounds, save only one&mdash;namely,
      that which love and vexation had dealt to his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he did return, and found himself in presence of his victorious foe,
      he could not but blush; and such was his confusion, that he who had
      formerly been the boldest of all the company, was often wholly abashed
      before her. Accordingly, being now quite certain that her suspicion was
      true, she estranged herself from him little by little, though not so
      adroitly that he did not perceive it; but he durst not give any sign for
      fear of meeting with something still worse, and so he kept his love
      concealed, patiently enduring the disgrace he had so well deserved.(12)

      &ldquo;This, ladies, is a story which should be a warning to those who would
      grasp at what does not belong to them, and which, further, should
      strengthen the hearts of ladies, since it shows the virtue of this young
      Princess, and the good sense of her lady of honour. If the like fortune
      should befall any among you, the remedy has now been pointed out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;that the tall gentleman of whom you have
      told us was so lacking in spirit as to be unworthy of being remembered.
      With such an opportunity as that, he ought not to have suffered any one,
      old or young, to baffle him in his enterprise. It must be said, also, that
      his heart was not entirely filled with love, seeing that fear of death and
      shame found place within it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what,&rdquo; replied Nomerfide, &ldquo;could the poor gentleman have done with
      two women against him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He ought to have killed the old one,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;and when the young
      one found herself without assistance she would have been already half
      subdued.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To have killed her!&rdquo; said Nomerfide. &ldquo;Then you would turn a lover into a
      murderer? Since such is your opinion, it would indeed be a fearful thing
      to fall into your hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had gone so far,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;I should have held it dishonourable
      not to achieve my purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then said Geburon&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think it strange that a Princess, bred in all honour, should prove
      difficult of capture to one man. You should then be much more astonished
      at a poor woman who escaped out of the hands of two.&rdquo;

    <p>
      &ldquo;Geburon,&rdquo; said Ennasuite, &ldquo;I give my vote to you to tell the fifth tale,

      displeasing to us.&rdquo;

    <p>
      &ldquo;Since you have chosen me,&rdquo; said Geburon, &ldquo;I will tell you a story which I
      know to be true from having made inquiries concerning it on the spot. By
      this story you will see that womanly sense and virtue are not in the
      hearts and heads of Princesses alone, nor love and cunning in such as are
      most often deemed to possess them.&rdquo;

      <i>TALE V.</i>
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>Two Grey Friars, when crossing the river at the haven of
     Coulon, sought to ravish the boatwoman who was taking them
     over. She, however, being virtuous and Clever, so beguiled
     them with words that, whilst promising to grant their
     request, she deceived them and handed them over to justice.
     They were then delivered up to their warden to receive such
     punishment as they deserved</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      At the haven of Coulon,(1) near Nyort, there lived a boatwoman who, day or
      night, did nothing but convey passengers across the ferry.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  The village of Coulon, in  Poitou (department of the Deux-
     Sèvres), lies within seven miles of Niort, on the Niortaise
     Sevre, which at this point is extremely wide.&mdash;L.
</pre>
    <p>
      Now it chanced that two Grey Friars from Nyort were crossing the river
      alone with her, and as the passage is one of the longest in France, they
      began to make love to her, that she might not feel dull by the way. She
      returned them the answer that was due; but they, being neither fatigued by
      their journeying, nor cooled by the water, nor put to shame by her
      refusal, determined to take her by force, and, if she clamoured, to throw
      her into the river. She, however, was as virtuous and clever as they were
      gross and wicked, and said to them&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not so ill-disposed as I seem to be, but I pray you grant me two
      requests. You shall then see that I am more ready to give than you are to
      ask.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The friars swore to her by their good St. Francis that she could ask
      nothing that they would not grant in order to have what they desired of
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First of all,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I require you both to promise on oath that you
      will inform no man living of this matter.&rdquo; This they promised right
      willingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;I would have you take your pleasure with me one
      after the other, for it would be too great a shame for me to have to do
      with one in presence of the other. Consider which of you will have me
      first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They deemed her request a very reasonable one, and the younger friar
      yielded the first place to the elder. Then, as they were drawing near a
      little island, she said to the younger one&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good father, say your prayers here until I have taken your companion to
      another island. Then, if he praises me when he comes back, we will leave
      him here, and go away in turn together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The younger friar leapt out on to the island to await the return of his
      comrade, whom the boat-woman took away with her to another island. When
      they had reached the bank she said to him, pretending the while to fasten
      her boat to a tree&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look, my friend, and see where we can place ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The good father stepped on to the island to seek for a convenient spot,
      but no sooner did she see him on land than she struck her foot against the
      tree and went off with her boat into the open stream, leaving both the
      good fathers to their deserts, and crying out to them as loudly as she
      could&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait now, sirs, till the angel of God comes to console you; for you shall
      have nought that could please you from me to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two poor monks, perceiving that they had been deceived, knelt down at
      the water&rsquo;s edge and besought her not to put them to such shame; and they
      promised that they would ask nothing of her if she would of her goodness
      take them to the haven. But, still rowing away, she said to them&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be doubly foolish if, after escaping out of your hands, I were
      to put myself into them again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When she had come to the village, she went to call her husband and the
      ministers of justice that they might go and take these fierce wolves, from
      whose fangs she had by the grace of God escaped. They set out accompanied
      by many people, for there was no one, big or little, but wished to share
      in the pleasure of this chase.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the poor brethren saw such a large company approaching, they hid
      themselves each in his island, even as Adam did when he perceived his
      nakedness in the presence of God.(2) Shame set their sin clearly before
      them, and the fear of punishment made them tremble so that they were half
      dead. Nevertheless, they were taken prisoners amid the mockings and
      hootings of men and women.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some said, &ldquo;These good fathers preach chastity to us and then rob our
      wives of theirs.&rdquo; (3)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     2  See <i>Genesis</i> iii. 8-10.

     3  The editions of 1558 and 1560 here contain this
     additional phrase: &ldquo;They do not dare to touch money with
     bare hands, and yet they willingly finger the thighs of our
     wives, which are more dangerous.&rdquo;&mdash;L.
</pre>
    <p>
      Others said, &ldquo;They are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear
      beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men&rsquo;s bones and
      uncleanness.&rdquo; (4) Then another voice cried, &ldquo;By their fruits shall ye know
      what manner of trees they are.&rdquo; (5)
    </p>
    <p>
      You may be sure that all the passages in the Gospel condemning hypocrites
      were brought forward against the unhappy prisoners, who were, however,
      rescued and delivered by their Warden,(6) who came in all haste to claim
      them, assuring the ministers of justice that he would visit them with a
      greater punishment than laymen would venture to inflict, and that they
      should make reparation by saying as many masses and prayers as might be
      required. The judge granted the Warden&rsquo;s request and gave the prisoners up
      to him; and the Warden, who was an upright man, so dealt with them that
      they never afterwards crossed a river without making the sign of the cross
      and recommending themselves to God.(7)

     Warden.&mdash;B.J.

     7 Henry Etienne quotes this story in his <i>Apologie pour
     Hérodote</i>, and praises the Queen for thus denouncing the
     evil practices of the friars.&mdash;F.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pray you, ladies, consider, since this poor boatwoman had the wit to
      deceive two such evil men, what should be done by those who have read of
      and witnessed so many fair examples, and who have had the goodness of
      virtuous ladies ever before their eyes? Indeed, the virtue of well-bred
      women is not so much to be called virtue as habit. It is in the women who
      know nothing, who hear scarcely two good sermons during the whole year,
      who have no leisure to think of aught save the gaining of their miserable
      livelihood, and who nevertheless jealously guard their chastity,
      hard-pressed as they may be (8)&mdash;it is in such women as these that
      one discovers the virtue that is natural to the heart. Where man&rsquo;s wit and
      might are smallest, there the Spirit of God performs the greatest work.
      And unhappy indeed is the lady who keeps not close ward over the treasure
      which brings her so much honour if it be well guarded, and so much shame
      if it be neglected.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     8 Boaistuau&rsquo;s edition of 1558 here contains the following
     interpolation: &ldquo;As should be done by those who, having their
     lives provided for, have no occupation save that of studying
     Holy Writ, listening to sermons and preaching, and exerting
     themselves to act virtuously in all things.&rdquo;&mdash;L.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me, Geburon,&rdquo; said Longarine, &ldquo;that there is no great virtue
      in refusing a Grey Friar, and that it would rather be impossible to love
      one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Longarine,&rdquo; replied Geburon, &ldquo;they who are not accustomed to such lovers
      as yours do by no means despise the Grey Friars, for the latter are as
      handsome and as strong as we are, and they are readier and fresher also,
      for we are worn-out with our service. Moreover, they talk like angels and
      are as importunate as the devil, so that such women as have never seen
      other robes than their coarse drugget ones,(9) are truly virtuous when
      they escape out of their hands.&rdquo;

      Nomerfide took this question in bad part, for she thought that she was
      esteemed by Oisille less highly than she desired. Accordingly she answered
      in anger&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are some who have refused more agreeable men than Grey Friars
      without blowing a trumpet about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oisille laughed to see her so wrathful, and said to her&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still less do they beat a drum about what they have done and granted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Geburon, &ldquo;that Nomerfide wishes to speak. I therefore give
      her my vote that she may relieve her heart in telling us some excellent
      story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has just been said,&rdquo; replied Nomerfide, &ldquo;touches me so little that
      it affords me neither pleasure nor pain. However, since I have your vote,
      I pray you listen to me whilst I show that, although one woman used
      cunning for a good purpose, others have been crafty for evil&rsquo;s sake. Since
      we have sworn to tell the truth I will not hide it, for just as the
      boatwoman&rsquo;s virtue brings no honour to other women unless they follow her
      example, so the vice of another cannot disgrace her. Wherefore, listen.&rdquo;

      <i>TALE VI</i>.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>An old one-eyed valet in the service of the Duke of Alençon
     being advised that his wife was in love with a young man,
     desired to know the truth, and feigned to go away into the
     country for a few days. He returned, however, so suddenly
     that his wife, on whom he was keeping watch, perceived how
     matters stood, and whilst thinking to deceive her, he was
     himself deceived</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      There was in the service of Charles, last Duke of Alençon, an old valet
      who had lost an eye, and who was married to a wife much younger than
      himself. Now, since his master and mistress liked him as well as any man
      of his condition that was in their service, he was not able to visit his
      wife as often as he could have wished. Owing to this she so far forgot her
      honour and conscience as to fall in love with a young man, and the affair
      being at last noised abroad, the husband heard of it. He could not believe
      it, however, on account of the many notable tokens of love that were shown
      him by his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, he one day determined to put the matter to the test, and to
      take revenge, if he were able, on the woman who had put him to such shame.
      For this purpose he pretended to go away to a place a short distance off
      for the space of two or three days.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as he was gone, his wife sent for her lover, but he had not been
      with her for half-an-hour when the husband arrived and knocked loudly at
      the door. The wife well knew who it was and told her lover, who was so
      greatly confounded that he would fain have been in his mother&rsquo;s womb, and
      cursed both his mistress and the love that had brought him into such
      peril. However, she bade him fear nothing, for she would devise a means to
      get him away without harm or shame to him, and she told him to dress
      himself as quickly as he could. All this time the husband was knocking at
      the door and calling to his wife at the top of his voice; but she feigned
      not to recognise him, and cried out to the people of the house&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you not get up and silence those who are making such a clamour at
      the door? Is this an hour to come to the houses of honest folk? If my
      husband were here he would soon make them desist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On hearing his wife&rsquo;s voice the husband called to her as loudly as he
      could&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wife, open the door. Are you going to keep me waiting here till morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, when she saw that her lover was ready to set forth, she opened the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, husband!&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;how glad I am that you are come. I have just
      had a wonderful dream, and was so pleased that I never before knew such
      delight, for it seemed to me that you had recovered the sight of your
      eye.&rdquo; (1)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  This is taken from No. xvi. of the <i>Cent Nouvelles
     Nouvelles</i>, in which the wife exclaims: &ldquo;Verily, at the very
     moment when you knocked, my lord, I was greatly occupied
     with a dream about you.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;And what was it, sweetheart?&rdquo;
      asks the husband.&mdash;&ldquo;By my faith, my lord,&rdquo; replies the wife,
     &ldquo;it really seemed to me that you were come back, that you
     were speaking to me, and that you saw as clearly with one
     eye as with the other.&rdquo;&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      Then, embracing and kissing him, she took him by the head and covering his
      good eye with one hand, she asked him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you not see better than you did before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment, whilst he saw not a whit, she made her lover sally forth.
      The husband immediately suspected the trick, and said to her&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Fore God, wife, I will keep watch on you no more, for in thinking to
      deceive you, I have myself met with the cunningest deception that ever was
      devised. May God mend you, for it is beyond the power of man to put a stop
      to the maliciousness of a woman, unless by killing her outright. However,
      since the fair treatment I have accorded you has availed nothing for your
      amendment, perchance the scorn I shall henceforward hold you in will serve
      as a punishment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying he went away, leaving his wife in great distress. Nevertheless
      by the intercession of his friends and her own excuses and tears, he was
      persuaded to return to her again.(2)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     2 Although Queen Margaret ascribes the foregoing adventure
     to one of the officers of her husband&rsquo;s household, and
     declares that the narrative is quite true, the same subject
     had been dealt with by most of the old story-tellers prior
     to her time, and Deslongchamps points out the same incidents
     even in the early Hindoo fables (see the <i>Pantcha Tantra</i>,
     book I., fable vi.). A similar tale is to be found in the
     <i>Gesta Romanorum</i> (cap. cxxii.), in the <i>fabliaux</i> collected
     by Legrand d&rsquo;Aussy (vol. iv., &ldquo;De la mauvaise femme&rdquo;), in P.
     Alphonse&rsquo;s <i>Disciplina Clericalis</i> (fab. vii.), in the
     <i>Decameron</i> (day vii., story vi.), and in the <i>Cent
     Nouvelles Nouvelles</i> (story xvi.). Imitations are also to be
     found in Bandello (part i., story xxiii.), Malespini (story
     xliv.), Sansovino (<i>Cento Novelle</i>), Sabadino (<i>Novelle</i>),
     Etienne (<i>Apologiepour Hérodote</i>, ch. xv. ), De la Monnoye
     (vol. ii.), D&rsquo;Ouville (<i>Contes</i>, vol. ii.), &amp;c.&mdash;L. &amp; B. J.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By this tale, ladies, you may see how quick and crafty a woman is in
      escaping from danger. And if her wit be quick to discover the means of
      concealing a bad deed, it would, in my belief, be yet more subtle in
      avoiding evil or in doing good; for I have always heard it said that wit
      to do well is ever the stronger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may talk of your cunning as much as you please,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;but my
      opinion is that had the same fortune befallen you, you could not have
      concealed the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had as lief you deemed me the most foolish woman on earth,&rdquo; she
      replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not say that,&rdquo; answered Hircan, &ldquo;but I think you more likely to be
      confounded by slander than to devise some cunning means to silence it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think,&rdquo; said Nomerfide, &ldquo;that every one is like you, who would use
      one slander for the patching of another; but there is danger lest the
      patch impair what it patches and the foundation be so overladen that all
      be destroyed. However, if you think that the subtlety, of which all
      believe you to be fully possessed, is greater than that found in women, I
      yield place to you to tell the seventh story; and, if you bring yourself
      forward as the hero, I doubt not that we shall hear wickedness enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not here,&rdquo; replied Hircan, &ldquo;to make myself out worse than I am;
      there are some who do that rather more than is to my liking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying he looked at his wife, who quickly said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not fear to tell the truth on my account. I can more easily bear to
      hear you relate your crafty tricks than to see them played before my eyes,
      though none of them could lessen the love I bear you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For that reason,&rdquo; replied Hircan, &ldquo;I make no complaint of all the false
      opinions you have had of me. And so, since we understand each other, there
      will be more security for the future. Yet I am not so foolish as to relate
      a story of myself, the truth of which might be vexatious to you. I will
      tell you one of a gentleman who was among my dearest friends.&rdquo;

      <i>TALE VII</i>.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>By the craft and subtlety of a merchant an old woman was
     deceived and the honour of her daughter saved</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      In the city of Paris there lived a merchant who was in love with a young
      girl of his neighbourhood, or, to speak more truly, she was more in love
      with him than he with her. For the show he made to her of love and
      devotion was but to conceal a loftier and more honourable passion.
      However, she suffered herself to be deceived, and loved him so much that
      she had quite forgotten the way to refuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the merchant had long taken trouble to go where he could see her, he
      at last made her come whithersoever it pleased himself. Her mother
      discovered this, and being a very virtuous woman, she forbade her daughter
      ever to speak to the merchant on pain of being sent to a nunnery. But the
      girl, whose love for the merchant was greater than her fear of her mother,
      went after him more than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened one day, when she was in a closet all alone, the merchant came
      in to her, and finding himself in a place convenient for the purpose, fell
      to conversing with her as privily as was possible. But a maid-servant, who
      had seen him go in, ran and told the mother, who betook herself thither in
      great wrath. When the girl heard her coming, she said, weeping, to the
      merchant&mdash;&ldquo;Alas! sweetheart, the love that I bear you will now cost
      me dear. Here comes my mother, who will know for certain what she has
      always feared and suspected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The merchant, who was not a bit confused by this accident, straightway
      left the girl and went to meet the mother. Stretching out his arms, he
      hugged her with all his might, and, with the same ardour with which he had
      begun to entertain the daughter, threw the poor old woman on to a small
      bed. She was so taken aback at being thus treated that she could find
      nothing to say but&mdash;&ldquo;What do you want? Are you dreaming?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For all that he ceased not to press her as closely as if she had been the
      fairest maiden in the world, and had she not cried out so loudly that her
      serving-men and women came to her aid, she would have gone by the same
      road as she feared her daughter was treading.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the servants dragged the poor old woman by main force out of the
      merchant&rsquo;s arms, and she never knew for what reason he had thus used her.
      Meanwhile, her daughter took refuge in a house hard by where a wedding was
      going on. Since then she and the merchant have ofttimes laughed together
      at the expense of the old woman, who was never any the wiser.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By this story, ladies, you may see how, by the subtlety of a man, an old
      woman was deceived and the honour of a young one saved. Any one who would
      give the names, or had seen the merchant&rsquo;s face and the consternation of
      the old woman, would have a very tender conscience to hold from laughing.
      It is sufficient for me to prove to you by this story that a man&rsquo;s wit is
      as prompt and as helpful at a pinch as a woman&rsquo;s, and thus to show you,
      ladies, that you need not fear to fall into men&rsquo;s hands. If your own wit
      should fail you, you will find theirs prepared to shield your honour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In truth, Hircan,&rdquo; said Longarine, &ldquo;I grant that the tale is a very
      pleasant one and the wit great, but the example is not such as maids
      should follow. I readily believe there are some whom you would fain have
      approve it, but you are not so foolish as to wish that your wife, or her
      whose honour you set higher than her pleasure,(1) should play such a game.
      I believe there is none who would watch them more closely or shield them
      more readily than you.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  M. Frank, adopting the generally received opinion that
     Hircan is King Henry of Navarre, believes this to be an
     allusion to one of the King&rsquo;s sisters&mdash;Ann, who married the
     Count of Estrac, or Isabel, who married M. de Rohan&mdash;but it
     is more likely that Henry&rsquo;s daughter, Jane d&rsquo;Albret, is the
     person referred  to.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By my conscience,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;if she whom you mention had done such a
      thing, and I knew nothing about it, I should think none the less of her.
      For all I know, some one may have played as good a trick on me; however,
      knowing nothing, I am unconcerned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this Parlamente could not refrain from saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A wicked man cannot but be suspicious; happy are those who give no
      occasion for suspicion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never seen a great fire from which there came no smoke,&rdquo; said
      Longarine, &ldquo;but I have often seen smoke where there was no fire. The
      wicked are as suspicious when there is no mischief as when there is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truly, Longarine,&rdquo; Hircan forthwith rejoined, &ldquo;you have spoken so well in
      support of the honour of ladies wrongfully suspected, that I give you my
      vote to tell the eighth tale. I hope, however, that you will not make us
      weep, as Madame Oisille did, by too much praise of virtuous women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this Longarine laughed heartily, and thus began:&mdash;&ldquo;You want me to
      make you laugh, as is my wont, but it shall not be at women&rsquo;s expense. I
      will show you, however, how easy it is to deceive them when they are
      inclined to be jealous and esteem themselves clever enough to deceive
      their husbands.&rdquo;

      A. (Prologue, Page 31.)
    </h2>
    <p>
      The dedication with which Anthony Le Maçon prefaces his translation of
      Boccaccio contains several curious passages. In it Margaret is styled &ldquo;the
      most high and most illustrious Princess Margaret of France, only sister of
      the King, Queen of Navarre, Duchess of Alençon and of Berry;&rdquo; while the
      author describes himself as &ldquo;Master Anthoine Le Maçon, Councillor of the
      King, Receiver General of his finances in Burgundy, and very humble
      secretary to this Queen.&rdquo; He then proceeds to say:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You remember, my lady, the time when you made a stay of four or five
      months in Paris, during which you commanded me, seeing that I had freshly
      arrived from Florence, where I had sojourned during an entire year, to
      read to you certain stories of the <i>Decameron</i> of Boccaccio, after
      which it pleased you to command me to translate the whole book into our
      French language, assuring me that it would be found beautiful and
      entertaining. I then made you reply that I felt my powers were too weak to
      undertake such a work.... My principal and most reasonable excuse was the
      knowledge that I had of myself, being a native of the land of Dauphiné,
      where the maternal language is too far removed from good French....
      However, it did not please you to accept any of my excuses, and you showed
      me that it was not fitting that the Tuscans should be so mistaken as to
      believe that their Boccaccio could not be rendered in our language as well
      as it is in theirs, ours having become so rich and so copious since the
      accession of the King, your brother, to the crown, that nothing has ever
      been written in any language that could not be expressed in this; and thus
      your will still was that I should translate it (the <i>Decameron</i>) when
      I had the leisure to do so. Seeing this and desiring, throughout my life,
      to do, if I can, even more than is possible to obey you, I began some time
      afterwards to translate one of the said stories, then two, then three, and
      finally to the number of ten or twelve, the best that I could choose,
      which I afterwards showed as much to people of the Tuscan nation as to
      people of ours, who all made me believe that the stories were, if not
      perfectly, at least very faithfully translated. Wherefore, allowing myself
      to be thus pleasantly deceived, if deceit there was, I have since set
      myself to begin the translation at one end and to finish it at the
      other....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This dedicatory preface is followed by an epistle, written in Italian by
      Emilio Ferretti, and dated from Lyons, May I, 1545; and by a notice to the
      reader signed by Etienne Rosset, the bookseller, who in the King&rsquo;s
      license, dated from St. Germain-en-Laye, Nov. 2, 1544, is described as
      &ldquo;Rosset called the Mower, bookseller, residing in Paris, on the bridge of
      St. Michael, at the sign of the White Rose.&rdquo; The first edition of Le
      Maçon&rsquo;s translation (1545) was in folio; the subsequent ones of 1548,
      1551, and 1553 being in octavo. It should be remembered that Le Maçon&rsquo;s
      was by no means the first French version of the <i>Decameron</i>. Laurent
      du Premier-Faict had already rendered Boccaccio&rsquo;s masterpiece into French
      in the reign of Charles VI., but unfortunately his translation, although
      of a pleasing naïveté, was not at all correct, having been made from a
      Latin version of the original. Manuscript copies of Laurent&rsquo;s translation
      were to be found in the royal and most of the princely libraries of the
      fifteenth century.&mdash;Ed.

    <p>
      The letters of remission which at the instance of Henry VIII. were granted
      to Michael de St. Aignan in respect of the murder of James du Mesnil are
      preserved in the National Archives of France (Register J. 234, No. 191),
      and after the usual preamble, recite the culprit&rsquo;s petition in these
      terms:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whereas it appears from the prayer of Michael de St. Aignan, lord of the
      said place, (1) that heretofore he for a long time lived and resided in
      the town of Alençon in honour and good repute; but, to the detriment of
      his prosperity, life, and conduct there were divers evil-minded and
      envious persons who by sinister, cunning, and hidden means persecuted him
      with all the evils, wiles, and deceits that it is possible to conceive,
      albeit the said suppliant had never caused them displeasure, injury, or
      detriment; among others, one named James Dumesnil, a young man, to whom
      the said suppliant had procured all the pleasure and advantages that were
      in his power, and whom he had customarily admitted to his house, thinking
      that the said Dumesnil was his loyal friend, and charging his wife and his
      servants to treat him when he came as though he were his brother; by which
      means St. Aignan hoped to induce the said Dumesnil to espouse one of his
      relatives.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1 This was in all probability the village of St. Aignan on
     the Sarthe, between Moulins-la-Marche and Bazoches, and
     about twenty miles from Alençon. The personage here
     mentioned should not be confounded with Emery de
     Beauvilliers, whom Francis I. created Count of St. Aignan
     (on the Cher), and whose descendants, many of whom were
     distinguished generals and diplomatists, became dukes of the
     same place.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Dumesnil ill-requited the aforesaid good services and courtesies, and
      rendering evil for good, as is the practice of iniquity, endeavoured to
      and did cause an estrangement between the said St. Aignan and his wife,
      who had always lived together in good, great, and perfect affection. And
      the better to effect his purpose he (Dumesnil) gave the said wife to
      understand, among other things, that St. Aignan bore her no affection;
      that he daily desired her death; that she was mistaken in trusting him;
      and other evil things not fitting to be repeated, which the wife
      withstood, enjoining Dumesnil not to use such language again, as should he
      do so she would repeat it to her husband; but Dumesnil, persevering, on
      divers occasions when St. Aignan had absented himself, gave the wife of
      the latter to understand that he (St. Aignan) was dead, devising proofs
      thereof and conjectures, and thinking that by this means he would win her
      favour and countenance. But she still resisted him, which seeing, the said
      Dumesnil gave her to understand that St. Aignan would often absent
      himself, and that she would be happier if she had a husband who remained
      with her. And plotting to compass the death of the said St. Aignan,
      Dumesnil gave her to understand that if she would consent to the death of
      her husband he would marry her; and, in fact, he promised to marry her.
      And whereas she still refused to consent, the said Dumesnil found a means
      to gain a servant woman of the house, who, St. Aignan being absent and his
      wife in bed, opened the door to Dumesnil, who compelled the said wife to
      let him lie with her. And thenceforward Dumesnil made divers presents to
      the servant woman, so that she should poison the said suppliant; and she
      consented to his face; but at Easter confessed the matter to St. Aignan,
      entreating his forgiveness, and also saying and declaring it to the
      neighbours. And the said Dumesnil, knowing that he would incur blame and
      reproach if the matter were brought forward, seized and abducted the said
      servant woman in all diligence, and took her away from the town, whereby a
      scandal was occasioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Moreover, it would appear that the said Dumesnil had been found several
      times by night watching the gardens and the door in view of slaying St.
      Aignan, as is notorious in Alençon, by virtue of the admission of the said
      Dumesnil himself. Whereupon St. Aignan, seeing his wife thus made the
      subject of scandal by Dumesnil, enjoined him to abstain from coming to his
      house to see his wife, and to consider the outrage and injury he had
      already inflicted upon him; declaring moreover that he could endure no
      more. To which Dumesnil refused to listen, declaring that he would
      frequent the house in spite of every one; albeit, in doing so, he might
      come by his death. Thereupon St. Aignan, being acquainted with the evil
      obstinacy of Dumesnil and desirous of avoiding greater misfortune,
      departed from the town of Alençon, and went to reside in the town of
      Argentan, ten leagues distant, whither he took his wife, thinking that
      Dumesnil would abstain from coming. Withal he did not abstain, but came
      several times to the said town of Argentan, and frequented his (St.
      Aignan&rsquo;s) wife; whereby the people of Argentan were scandalised. And the
      said St. Aignan endeavoured to prevent him from coming, and employed the
      nurse of his child to remonstrate with Dumesnil, but the latter
      persevered, saying and declaring that he would kill St. Aignan, and would
      still go to Argentan, albeit it might cause his death. Insomuch that the
      said Dumesnil, on the eighth day of this month, departed from Alençon
      between two and three o&rsquo;clock in the morning, a suspicious hour, having
      disguised himself and assumed attire unsuited to his calling, which is
      that of the law; wearing a Bearnese cloak,(2) a jacket of white woollen
      stuff underneath, all torn into strips, with a feathered cap upon his
      head, and having his face covered. In this wise he arrived at the said
      town of Argentan, accompanied by two young men, and lodged in the
      faubourgs at the sign of Notre Dame, and remained there clandestinely from
      noon till about eleven o&rsquo;clock in the evening, when he asked the host for
      the key of the backdoor, so that he might go out on his private affairs,
      not wishing to be recognised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the said suspicious hour, with his sword at his side,(3) and dressed
      and accoutred in the said garments, he started from his lodging with one
      of the said young men.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     2  See <i>ante</i>, p. 24, note 8.

     3  The French word is <i>basion</i>, which in the sixteenth
     century was often used to imply a sword; arquebuses and
     musketoons being termed <i>basions à feu</i> by way of
     distinction. Moreover, it is expressly stated farther on
     that Dumesnil had a sword.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In this wise Dumesnil reached the house of St. Aignan, which he found a
      means of entering, and gained a closet up above, near the room where the
      said St. Aignan and his wife slept. St. Aignan was without thought of
      this, inasmuch as he was ignorant of the enterprise of the said Dumesnil,
      being in the living room with one Master Thomas Guérin, who had come upon
      business. Now, as St. Aignan was disposing himself to go to bed, he told
      one of his servants, named Colas, to bring him his <i>cas</i> (4) and the
      servant having occasion to go up into a closet in which St. Aignan&rsquo;s wife
      was sleeping, and in which the said Dumesnil was concealed, the latter,
      fearing that he might be recognised, suddenly came out with a drawn sword
      in his hand; whereupon the said Colas cried: &lsquo;Help! There is a robber!&rsquo;
      And he declared to St. Aignan that he had seen a strange man who did not
      seem to be there for any good purpose; whereupon St. Aignan said to him:
      &lsquo;One must find out who it is. Is there occasion for any one to come here
      at this hour?&rsquo; Thereupon Colas went after the said personage, whom he
      found in a little alley near the courtyard behind the house; and the said
      personage, having suddenly perceived Colas, endeavoured to strike him on
      the body with his weapon; but Colas withstood him and gave him a few
      blows,(5) for which reason he cried out &lsquo;Help! Murder!&rsquo; Thereupon St.
      Aignan arrived, having a sword in his hand; and after him came the said
      Guérin. St. Aignan, who as yet did not know Dumesnil on account of his
      disguise, and also because it was wonderfully dark, found him calling out:
      &lsquo;Murder! Confession!&rsquo; By which cry the said St. Aignan knew him, and was
      greatly perplexed, astonished, and angered, at seeing his enemy at such an
      hour in his house, he having been found there, with a weapon, in the
      closet. And the said St. Aignan recalling to memory the trouble and worry
      that Dumesnil had caused him, dealt him two or three thrusts in hot anger,
      and then said to him: &lsquo;Hey! Wretch that thou art, what hast brought thee
      here? Wert thou not content with the wrong thou didst me in coming here
      previously? I never did thee an ill office.&rsquo; Whereupon the said Dumesnil
      said: &lsquo;It is true, I have too grievously offended you, and am too wicked;
      I entreat your pardon.&rsquo; And thereupon he fell to the ground as if dead;
      which seeing, the said St. Aignan, realising the misfortune that had
      happened, said not a word, but recommended himself to God and withdrew
      into his room, where he found his wife in bed, she having heard nothing.
    </p>

     4 The <i>en cas</i> was a kind of light supper provided <i>in case</i>
     one felt hungry at night-time. Most elaborate <i>en cas</i>,
     consisting of several dishes, were frequently provided for
     the kings of France.&mdash;Ed.

     5 In the story Margaret asserts that it was Thomas Guérin
     who attacked Dumesnil.&mdash;D.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the night of the said dispute, and a little later, St. Aignan went to
      see what the said Dumesnil was doing, and finding him in the courtyard
      dead, he helped to carry him into the stable, being too greatly incensed
      to act otherwise. And upon the said Colas asking him what should be done
      with the body, St. Aignan paid no heed to this question, because he was
      not master of himself; but merely said to Colas that he might do as he
      thought fit, and that the body might be interred in consecrated ground or
      placed in the street. After which St. Aignan withdrew into his room and
      slept with his wife, who had her maids with her. And on the morrow this
      same Colas declared to St. Aignan that he had taken the said body to be
      buried, so as to avoid a scandal. To all of which things St. Aignan paid
      no heed, but on the morrow sent to fetch the two young men in the service
      of the said Dumesnil, who were at his lodging, and had the horses removed
      from the said lodging, and gave orders to one of the young men to take
      them back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On account of all which occurrences he (St. Aignan) absented himself,
      &amp;c, &amp;c, but humbly entreating us, &amp;c, &amp;c. Wherefore we now
      give to the Bailiffs of Chartres and Caen, or to their Lieutenants, and to
      each of them severally and to all, &amp;c, &amp;c. Given at Châtelherault,
      in the month of July, the year of Grace, one thousand five hundred and
      twenty-six, and the twelfth of our reign.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Signed: By the King on the report of the Council</i>:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;De Nogent.&ldquo;<i>Visa: contentor</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;De Nogent.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     It will be seen that the foregoing petition contains various
     contradictory statements. The closet, for instance, is at
     first described as being near the room in which St. Aignan
     and his wife slept, then it is asserted that the wife slept
     in the closet, but ultimately the husband is shown joining
     his wife in the bed-chamber, where she had heard nothing.
     The character of the narrative is proof of its falsity, and
     Margaret&rsquo;s account of the affair may readily be accepted as
     the more correct one.&mdash;Ed.

      C. (Tale IV., Page 85.)
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Les Vies des Dames galantes</i> contains the following passage bearing
      upon Margaret&rsquo;s 4th Tale. See Lalanne&rsquo;s edition of Brantôme&rsquo;s Works, vol.
      ix. p. 678 <i>et sec</i>.:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard a lady of great and ancient rank relate that the late
      Cardinal du Bellay, whilst a Bishop and Cardinal, married Madame de
      Chastillon, and died married; and this lady said it in conversing with
      Monsieur de Manne, a Provençal of the house of Seulal, and Bishop of
      Frejus, who had attended the said Cardinal during fifteen years at the
      Court of Rome, and had been one of his private protonotaries. The
      conversation turning upon the said Cardinal, this lady asked Monsieur de
      Manne if he (the Cardinal) had ever said and confessed to him that he had
      been married. It was Monsieur de Manne who was astonished at such a
      question. He is still alive and can say if I am telling an untruth, for I
      was there. He replied that he had never heard the matter spoken of either
      to himself or to others. &lsquo;Then it is I who inform you of it,&rsquo; said she,
      &lsquo;for nothing could be more true but that he was married, and died really
      married to Madame de Chastillon.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you that I laughed heartily, contemplating the astonished
      countenance of Monsieur de Manne, who was most conscientious and
      religious, and thought that he had known all the secrets of his late
      master; but he was as ignorant as a Gibuan as regards that one, which was
      indeed scandalous on account of the holy rank which he (Cardinal du
      Bellay) had held.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This Madame de Chastillon was the widow of the late Monsieur de
      Chastillon, of whom it was said that he governed the little King Charles
      VIII., with Bourdillon and Bonneval, who governed the royal blood. He died
      at Ferrara, where he had been taken to have his wounds dressed, having
      been wounded at the siege of Ravenna.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This lady became a widow when very young and beautiful, and on account of
      her being sensible and virtuous she was elected as lady of honour to the
      late Queen of Navarre. It was she who gave that fine advice to that lady
      and great princess, which is recorded in the hundred stories of the said
      Queen&mdash;the story of herself and a gentleman who had slipped into her
      bed during the night by a trap-door at the bedside, and who wished to
      enjoy her, but only obtained by it some fine scratches upon his handsome
      face. She (the Queen) wishing to complain to her brother, Madame de
      Chastillon made her that fine remonstrance which will be seen in the
      story, and gave her that beautiful advice which is one of the finest, most
      judicious, and most fitting that could be given to avoid scandal: did it
      come even from a first president of (the Parliament of) Paris. Yet it well
      showed that the lady was quite as artful and shrewd in such secret matters
      as she was sensible and prudent; and for this reason there is no need for
      doubt as to whether she kept her affair with the Cardinal a secret. My
      grandmother, Madame la Sénéchale of Poitou, had her place after her death,
      by election of King Francis who chose and elected her, and sent to fetch
      her even in her house, and gave her with his own hand to the Queen his
      sister, for he knew her to be a very well-advised and very virtuous lady,
      but not so shrewd, or artful, or ready-witted in such matters as her
      predecessor, or married either a second time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if you wish to know to whom the story applies, it is to the Queen of
      Navarre herself and Admiral de Bonnivet, as I hold it from my late
      grandmother; and yet it seems to me that the said Queen should not have
      concealed her name, since the other could not obtain aught from her
      chastity, but went off in confusion, and since she herself had meant to
      divulge the matter had it not been for the fine and sensible remonstrance
      which was made to her by the said lady of honour, Madame de Chastillon.
      Whoever has read the story will find that she was a lady of honour, and I
      think that the Cardinal, her said husband, who was one of the best
      speakers and most learned, eloquent, wise, and shrewd men of his time,
      must have instilled into her this science of speaking and remonstrating so
      well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brantôme also refers to the story in question in his <i>Vies des Hommes
      illustres et grands Capitaines français</i> (vol. ii. p. 162), wherein he
      says:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a tale in the stories of the Queen of Navarre, which speaks of a
      lord, the favourite of a king, whom he invited with all his court to one
      of his houses, where he made a trap-door in his room conducting to the
      bedside of a great princess, in view of lying with her, as he did, but, as
      the story relates, he obtained only scratches from her.&rdquo;

      <i>TALE VIII</i>.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>A certain Bornet, less loyal to his wife than she to him,
     desired to lie with his maidservant, and made his enterprise
     known to a friend, who, hoping to share in the spoil, so
     aided and abetted him, that whilst the husband thought to
     lie with his servant he in truth lay with his wife. Unknown
     to the latter, he then caused his friend to participate in
     the pleasure which rightly belonged to himself alone, and
     thus made himself a cuckold without there being any guilt on
     the part of his wife.</i> (1)
</pre>
    <p>
      In the county of Alletz (2) there lived a man named Bornet, who being
      married to an upright and virtuous wife, had great regard for her honour
      and reputation, as I believe is the case with all the husbands here
      present in respect to their own wives. But although he desired that she
      should be true to him, he was not willing that the same law should apply
      to both, for he fell in love with his maid-servant, from whom he had
      nothing to gain save the pleasure afforded by a diversity of viands.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  For a list of tales similar to this one, see <i>post</i>,
     Appendix A.

     2  Alletz, now Alais, a town of Lower Languedoc (department
     of the Gard), lies on the Gardon, at the foot of the
     Cevennes mountains. It was formerly a county, the title
     having been held by Charles, Duke of Angoulême, natural son
     of Charles IX.&mdash;M.
</pre>
    <p>
      Now he had a neighbour of the same condition as his own, named Sandras, a
      tabourer (3) and tailor by trade, and there was such friendship between
      them that, excepting Bornet&rsquo;s wife, they had all things in common. It thus
      happened that Bornet told his friend of the enterprise he had in hand
      against the maid-servant; and Sandras not only approved of it, but gave
      all the assistance he could to further its accomplishment, hoping that he
      himself might share in the spoil.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     3 Tabourers are still to be found in some towns of Lower
     Languedoc and in most of those of Provence, where they
     perambulate the streets playing their instruments. They are
     in great request at all the country weddings and other
     festive gatherings, as their instruments supply the
     necessary accompaniment to the ancient Provençal dance, the
     <i>farandole</i>.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      The maid-servant, however, was loth to consent, and finding herself hard
      pressed, she went to her mistress, told her of the matter, and begged
      leave to go home to her kinsfolk, since she could no longer endure to live
      in such torment. Her mistress, who had great love for her husband and had
      often suspected him, was well pleased to have him thus at a disadvantage,
      and to be able to show that she had doubted him justly. Accordingly, she
      said to the servant&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remain, my girl, but lead my husband on by degrees, and at last make an
      appointment to lie with him in my closet. Do not fail to tell me on what
      night he is to come, and see that no one knows anything about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The maid-servant did all that her mistress had commanded her, and her
      master in great content went to tell the good news to his friend. The
      latter then begged that, since he had been concerned in the business, he
      might have part in the result. This was promised him, and, when the
      appointed hour was come, the master went to lie, as he thought, with the
      maid-servant; but his wife, yielding up the authority of commanding for
      the pleasure of obeying, had put herself in the servant&rsquo;s place, and she
      received him, not in the manner of a wife, but after the fashion of a
      frightened maid. This she did so well that her husband suspected nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I cannot tell you which of the two was the better pleased, he at the
      thought that he was deceiving his wife, or she at really deceiving her
      husband. When he had remained with her, not as long as he wished, but
      according to his powers, which were those of a man who had long been
      married, he went out of doors, found his friend, who was much younger and
      lustier than himself, and told him gleefully that he had never met with
      better fortune. &ldquo;You know what you promised me,&rdquo; said his friend to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go quickly then,&rdquo; replied the husband, &ldquo;for she may get up, or my wife
      have need of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The friend went off and found the supposed maid-servant, who, thinking her
      husband had returned, denied him nothing that he asked of her, or rather
      took, for he durst not speak. He remained with her much longer than her
      husband had done, whereat she was greatly astonished, for she had not been
      wont to pass such nights. Nevertheless, she endured it all with patience,
      comforting herself with the thought of what she would say to him on the
      morrow, and of the ridicule that she would cast upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards daybreak the man rose from beside her, and toying with her as he
      was going away, snatched from her finger the ring with which her husband
      had espoused her, and which the women of that part of the country guard
      with great superstition. She who keeps it till her death is held in high
      honour, while she who chances to lose it, is thought lightly of as a
      person who has given her faith to some other than her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wife, however, was very glad to have it taken, thinking it would be a
      sure proof of how she had deceived her husband. When the friend returned,
      the husband asked him how he had fared. He replied that he was of the same
      opinion as himself, and that he would have remained longer had he not
      feared to be surprised by daybreak. Then they both went to the friend&rsquo;s
      house to take as long a rest as they could. In the morning, while they
      were dressing, the husband perceived the ring that his friend had on his
      finger, and saw that it was exactly like the one he had given to his wife
      at their marriage. He thereupon asked his friend from whom he had received
      the ring, and when he heard he had snatched it from the servant&rsquo;s finger,
      he was confounded and began to strike his head against the wall, saying&mdash;&ldquo;Ah!
      good Lord! have I made myself a cuckold without my wife knowing anything
      about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said his friend in order to comfort him, &ldquo;your wife gives her
      ring into the maid&rsquo;s keeping at night-time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The husband made no reply, but took himself home, where he found his wife
      fairer, more gaily dressed, and merrier than usual, like one who rejoiced
      at having saved her maid&rsquo;s conscience, and tested her husband to the full,
      at no greater cost than a night&rsquo;s sleep. Seeing her so cheerful, the
      husband said to himself&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she knew of my adventure she would not show me such a pleasant
      countenance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, whilst speaking to her of various matters, he took her by the hand,
      and on noticing that she no longer wore the ring, which she had never been
      accustomed to remove from her finger, he was quite overcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you done with your ring?&rdquo; he asked her in a trembling voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      She, well pleased that he gave her an opportunity to say what she desired,
      replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O wickedest of men! From whom do you imagine you took it? You thought it
      was from my maid-servant, for love of whom you expended more than twice as
      much of your substance as you ever did for me. The first time you came to
      bed I thought you as much in love as it was possible to be; but after you
      had gone out and were come back again, you seemed to be a very devil.
      Wretch! think how blind you must have been to bestow such praises on my
      person and lustiness, which you have long enjoyed without holding them in
      any great esteem. &lsquo;Twas, therefore, not the maid-servant&rsquo;s beauty that
      made the pleasure so delightful to you, but the grievous sin of lust which
      so consumes your heart and so clouds your reason that in the frenzy of
      your love for the servant you would, I believe, have taken a she-goat in a
      nightcap for a comely girl! Now, husband, it is time to amend your life,
      and, knowing me to be your wife, and an honest woman, to be as content
      with me as you were when you took me for a pitiful strumpet. What I did
      was to turn you from your evil ways, so that in your old age we might live
      together in true love and repose of conscience. If you purpose to continue
      your past life, I had rather be severed from you than daily see before my
      eyes the ruin of your soul, body, and estate. But if you will acknowledge
      the evil of your ways, and resolve to live in fear of God and obedience to
      His commandments, I will forget all your past sins, as I trust God will
      forget my ingratitude in not loving Him as I ought to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If ever man was reduced to despair it was this unhappy husband. Not only
      had he abandoned this sensible, fair, and chaste wife for a woman who did
      not love him, but, worse than this, he had without her knowledge made her
      a strumpet by causing another man to participate in the leasure which
      should have been for himself alone; and thus he had made himself horns of
      everlasting derision. However, seeing his wife in such wrath by reason of
      the love he had borne his maid-servant, he took care not to tell her of
      the evil trick that he had played her; and entreating her forgiveness,
      with promises of full amendment of his former evil life, he gave her back
      the ring which he had recovered from his friend. He entreated the latter
      not to reveal his shame; but, as what is whispered in the ear is always
      proclaimed from the housetop, the truth, after a time, became known, and
      men called him cuckold without imputing any shame to his wife.

    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me, ladies, that if all those who have committed like
      offences against their wives were to be punished in the same way, Hircan
      and Saffredent would have great cause for fear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Longarine,&rdquo; said Saffredent, &ldquo;are none in the company married save
      Hircan and I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed there are others,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;but none who would play a
      similar trick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whence did you learn,&rdquo; asked Saffredent, &ldquo;that we ever solicited our
      wives&rsquo; maid-servants?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the ladies who are in question,&rdquo; said Longarine, &ldquo;were willing to
      speak the truth, we should certainly hear of maid-servants dismissed
      without notice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; said Geburon, &ldquo;you are a most worthy lady! You promised to make
      the company laugh, and yet are angering these two poor gentlemen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tis all one,&rdquo; said Longarine: &ldquo;so long as they do not draw their swords,
      their anger will only serve to increase our laughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A pretty business indeed!&rdquo; said Hircan. &ldquo;Why, if our wives chose to
      believe this lady, she would embroil the seemliest household in the
      company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am well aware before whom I speak,&rdquo; said Longarine. &ldquo;Your wives are so
      sensible and bear you so much love, that if you were to give them horns as
      big as those of a deer, they would nevertheless try to persuade themselves
      and every one else that they were chaplets of roses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this the company, and even those concerned, laughed so heartily that
      their talk came to an end. However, Dagoucin, who had not yet uttered a
      word, could not help saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Men are very unreasonable when, having enough to content themselves with
      at home, they go in search of something else. I have often seen people
      who, not content with sufficiency, have aimed at bettering themselves, and
      have fallen into a worse position than they were in before. Such persons
      receive no pity, for fickleness is always blamed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what say you to those who have not found their other half?&rdquo; asked
      Simontault. &ldquo;Do you call it fickleness to seek it wherever it may be
      found?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since it is impossible,&rdquo; said Dagoucin, &ldquo;for a man to know the
      whereabouts of that other half with whom there would be such perfect union
      that one would not differ from the other, he should remain steadfast
      wherever love has attached him. And whatsoever may happen, he should
      change neither in heart nor in desire. If she whom you love be the image
      of yourself, and there be but one will between you, it is yourself you
      love, and not her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dagoucin,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;you are falling into error. You speak as though
      we should love women without being loved in return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hircan,&rdquo; replied Dagoucin, &ldquo;I hold that if our love be based on the
      beauty, grace, love, and favour of a woman, and our purpose be pleasure,
      honour, or profit, such love cannot long endure; for when the foundation
      on which it rests is gone, the love itself departs from us. But I am
      firmly of opinion that he who loves with no other end or desire than to
      love well, will sooner yield up his soul in death than suffer his great
      love to leave his heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In faith,&rdquo; said Simontault, &ldquo;I do not believe that you have ever been in
      love. If you had felt the flame like other men, you would not now be
      picturing to us Plato&rsquo;s <i>Republic</i>, which may be described in writing
      but not be put into practice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, I have been in love,&rdquo; said Dagoucin, &ldquo;and am so still, and shall
      continue so as long as I live. But I am in such fear lest the
      manifestation of this love should impair its perfection, that I shrink
      from declaring it even to her from whom I would fain have the like
      affection. I dare not even think of it lest my eyes should reveal it, for
      the more I keep my flame secret and hidden, the more does my pleasure
      increase at knowing that my love is perfect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For all that,&rdquo; said Geburon, &ldquo;I believe that you would willingly have
      love in return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not deny it,&rdquo; said Dagoucin, &ldquo;but even were I beloved as much as I
      love, my love would not be increased any more than it could be lessened,
      were it not returned with equal warmth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upon this Parlamente, who suspected this fantasy of Dagoucin&rsquo;s, said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care, Dagoucin; I have known others besides you who preferred to die
      rather than speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such persons, madam;&rdquo; said Dagoucin, &ldquo;I deem very happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless,&rdquo; said Saffredent, &ldquo;and worthy of a place among the innocents
      of whom the Church sings:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Non loquendo sed moriendo confessi sunt</i>.&rsquo; (4)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     4  From the ritual for the Feast of the Holy Innocents.&mdash;M.
</pre>
    <p>
      I have heard much of such timid lovers, but I have never yet seen one die.
      And since I myself have escaped death after all the troubles I have borne,
      I do not think that any one can die of love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Saffredent!&rdquo; said Dagoucin, &ldquo;how do you expect to be loved since
      those who are of your opinion never die? Yet have I known a goodly number
      who have died of no other ailment than perfect love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since you know such stories,&rdquo; said Longarine, &ldquo;I give you my vote to tell
      us a pleasant one, which shall be the ninth of to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the end,&rdquo; said Dagoucin, &ldquo;that signs and miracles may lead you to put
      faith in what I have said, I will relate to you something which happened
      less than three years ago.&rdquo;

      <i>TALE IX</i>.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>The perfect love borne by a gentleman to a damsel, being too deeply
      concealed and disregarded, brought about his death, to the great regret of
      his sweetheart</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between Dauphiné and Provence there lived a gentleman who was far richer
      in virtue, comeliness, and honour than in other possessions, and who was
      greatly in love with a certain damsel. I will not mention her name, out of
      consideration for her kinsfolk, who are of good and illustrious descent;
      but you may rest assured that my story is a true one. As he was not of
      such noble birth as herself, he durst not reveal his affection, for the
      love he bore her was so great and perfect that he would rather have died
      than have desired aught to her dishonour. Seeing that he was so greatly
      beneath her, he had no hope of marrying her; in his love, therefore, his
      only purpose was to love her with all his strength and as perfectly as he
      was able. This he did for so long a time that at last she had some
      knowledge of it; and, seeing that the love he bore her was so full of
      virtue and of good intent, she felt honoured by it, and showed him in turn
      so much favour that he, who sought nothing better than this, was well
      contented.
    </p>
    <p>
      But malice, which is the enemy of all peace, could not suffer this
      honourable and happy life to last, and certain persons spoke to the
      maiden&rsquo;s mother of their amazement at this gentleman being thought so much
      of in her house. They said that they suspected him of coming there more on
      account of her daughter than of aught else, adding that he had often been
      seen in converse with her. The mother, who doubted the gentleman&rsquo;s honour
      as little as that of any of her own children, was much distressed on
      hearing that his presence was taken in bad part, and, dreading lest
      malicious tongues should cause a scandal, she entreated that he would not
      for some time frequent her house as he had been wont to do. He found this
      hard to bear, for he knew that his honourable conversation with her
      daughter did not deserve such estrangement. Nevertheless, in order to
      silence evil gossip, he withdrew until the rumours had ceased; then he
      returned as before, his absence having in no wise lessened his love.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, however, whilst he was in the house, he heard some talk of
      marrying the damsel to a gentleman who did not seem to him to be so very
      rich that he should be entitled to take his mistress from him. So he began
      to pluck up courage, and engaged his friends to speak for him, believing
      that, if the choice were left to the damsel, she would prefer him to his
      rival. Nevertheless, the mother and kinsfolk chose the other suitor,
      because he was much richer; whereupon the poor gentleman, knowing his
      sweetheart to be as little pleased as himself, gave way to such sorrow,
      that by degrees, and without any other distemper, he became greatly
      changed, seeming as though he had covered the comeliness of his face with
      the mask of that death, to which hour by hour he was joyously hastening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, he could not refrain from going as often as was possible to
      converse with her whom he so greatly loved. But at last, when strength
      failed him, he was constrained to keep his bed; yet he would not have his
      sweetheart know of this, lest he should cast part of his grief on her. And
      giving himself up to despair and sadness, he was no longer able to eat,
      drink, sleep, or rest, so that it became impossible to recognise him by
      reason of his leanness and strangely altered features.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some one brought the news of this to his sweetheart&rsquo;s mother, who was a
      lady full of charity, and who had, moreover, such a liking for the
      gentleman, that if all the kinsfolk had been of the same opinion as
      herself and her daughter, his merits would have been preferred to the
      possessions of the other. But the kinsfolk on the father&rsquo;s side would not
      hear of it. However, the lady went with her daughter to see the unhappy
      gentleman, and found him more dead than alive. Perceiving that the end of
      his life was at hand, he had that morning confessed and received the Holy
      Sacrament, thinking to die without seeing anybody more. But although he
      was at death&rsquo;s door, when he saw her who for him was the resurrection and
      the life come in, he felt so strengthened that he started up in bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What motive,&rdquo; said he to the lady, &ldquo;has inclined you to come and see one
      who already has a foot in the grave, and of whose death you are yourself
      the cause?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is it possible,&rdquo; said the lady, &ldquo;that the death of one whom we like
      so well can be brought about by our fault? Tell me, I pray, why you speak
      in this manner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I concealed my love for your daughter as long as I
      was able; and my kinsfolk, in speaking of a marriage between myself and
      her, made known more than I desired, since I have thereby had the
      misfortune to lose all hope; not, indeed, in regard to my own pleasure,
      but because I know that she will never have such fair treatment and so
      much love from any other as she would have had from me. Her loss of the
      best and most loving friend she has in the world causes me more affliction
      than the loss of my own life, which I desired to preserve for her sake
      only. But since it cannot in any wise be of service to her, the loss of it
      is to me great gain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hearing these words, the lady and her daughter sought to comfort him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take courage, my friend,&rdquo; said the mother. &ldquo;I pledge you my word that, if
      God gives you back your health, my daughter shall have no other husband
      but you. See, she is here present, and I charge her to promise you the
      same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The daughter, weeping, strove to assure him of what her mother promised.
      He well knew, however, that even if his health were restored he would
      still lose his sweetheart, and that these fair words were only uttered in
      order somewhat to revive him. Accordingly, he told them that had they
      spoken to him thus three months before, he would have been the lustiest
      and happiest gentleman in France; but that their aid came so late, it
      could bring him neither belief nor hope. Then, seeing that they strove to
      make him believe them, he said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, since, on account of my feeble state, you promise me a blessing
      which, even though you would yourselves have it so, can never be mine, I
      will entreat of you a much smaller one, for which, however, I was never
      yet bold enough to ask.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They immediately vowed that they would grant it, and bade him ask boldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I entreat you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to place in my arms her whom you promise me for
      my wife, and to bid her embrace and kiss me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The daughter, who was unaccustomed to such familiarity, sought to make
      some difficulty, but her mother straightly commanded her, seeing that the
      gentleman no longer had the feelings or vigour of a living man. Being thus
      commanded, the girl went up to the poor sufferer&rsquo;s bedside, saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pray you, sweetheart, be of good cheer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, as well as he could, the dying man stretched forth his arms, wherein
      flesh and blood alike were lacking, and with all the strength remaining in
      his bones embraced her who was the cause of his death. And kissing her
      with his pale cold lips, he held her thus as long as he was able. Then he
      said to her&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The love I have borne you has been so great and honourable, that,
      excepting in marriage, I have never desired of you any other favour than
      the one you are granting me now, for lack of which and with which I shall
      cheerfully yield up my spirit to God. He is perfect love and charity. He
      knows the greatness of my love and the purity of my desire, and I beseech
      Him, while I hold my desire within my arms, to receive my spirit into His
      own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words he again took her in his arms, and with such exceeding
      ardour that his enfeebled heart, unable to endure the effort, was deprived
      of all its faculties and life; for joy caused it so to swell that the soul
      was severed from its abode and took flight to its Creator.
    </p>
    <p>
      And even when the poor body had lain a long time without life, and was
      thus unable to retain its hold, the love which the damsel had always
      concealed was made manifest in such a fashion that her mother and the dead
      man&rsquo;s servants had much ado to separate her from her lover. However, the
      girl, who, though living, was in a worse condition than if she had been
      dead, was by force removed at last out of the gentleman&rsquo;s arms. To him
      they gave honourable burial; and the crowning point of the ceremony was
      the weeping and lamentation of the unhappy damsel, who having concealed
      her love during his lifetime, made it all the more manifest after his
      death, as though she wished to atone for the wrong that she had done him.
      And I have heard that although she was given a husband to comfort her, she
      has never since had joy in her heart. (1)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  By an expression made use of by Dagoucin (see <i>ante</i>),
     Queen Margaret gives us to understand that the incidents
     here related occurred three years prior to the writing of
     the story. It may be pointed out, however, that there is
     considerable analogy between the conclusion of this tale and
     the death of Geffroy Rudel de Blaye, one of the earliest
     troubadours whose name has been handed down to us. Geffroy,
     who lived at the close of the twelfth century, became so
     madly enamoured of the charms of the Countess of Tripoli,
     after merely hearing an account of her moral and physical
     perfections, that, although in failing health, he embarked
     for Africa to see her. On reaching the port of Tripoli, he
     no longer had sufficient strength to leave the vessel,
     whereupon the Countess, touched by his love, visited him on
     board, taking his hand and giving him a kindly greeting.
     Geffroy could scarcely say a few words of thanks; his
     emotion was so acute that he died upon the spot. See J. de
     Nostredame&rsquo;s <i>Vies des plus Célèbres et Anciens Poëtes
     Provençaux</i>(Lyons, 1575, p. 25); Raynouard&rsquo;s <i>Choix des
     Poésies des Troubadours</i> (vol. v. p. 165); and also
     Raynouard&rsquo;s <i>Histoire Littéraire de la France</i> (vol. xiv. p.
     559).&mdash;L.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What think you of that, gentlemen, you who would not believe what I said?
      Is not this example sufficient to make you confess that perfect love, when
      concealed and disregarded, may bring folks to the grave? There is not one
      among you but knows the kinsfolk on the one and the other side, (2) and so
      you cannot doubt the story, although nobody would be disposed to believe
      it unless he had some experience in the matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     2  This certainly points to the conclusion that the tale is
     founded upon fact, and not, as M. Leroux de Lincy suggests,
     borrowed from the story of Geffroy Rudel de Blaye. It will
     have been observed (<i>ante</i>) that the Queen of Navarre
     curiously enough lays the scene of her narrative between
     Provence and Dauphiné. These two provinces bordered upon one
     another, excepting upon one point where they were separated
     by the so-called Comtat Venaissin or Papal state of Avignon.
     Here, therefore, the incidents of the story, if authentic,
     would probably have occurred. The story may be compared with
     Tale L. (<i>post</i>).&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      When the ladies heard this they all had tears in their eyes, but Hircan
      said to them&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was the greatest fool I ever heard of. By your faith, now, I ask you,
      is it reasonable that we should die for women who are made only for us, or
      that we should be afraid to ask them for what God has commanded them to
      give us? I do not speak for myself nor for any who are married. I myself
      have all that I want or more; but I say it for such men as are in need. To
      my thinking, they must be fools to fear those whom they should rather make
      afraid. Do you not perceive how greatly this poor damsel regretted her
      folly? Since she embraced the gentleman&rsquo;s dead body&mdash;an action
      repugnant to human nature&mdash;she would not have refused him while he
      was alive had he then trusted as much to boldness as he trusted to pity
      when he lay upon his death-bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;the gentleman most plainly showed that he
      bore her an honourable love, and for this he will ever be worthy of all
      praise. Chastity in a lover&rsquo;s heart is something divine rather than
      human.&rdquo;

      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said Saffredent, &ldquo;in support of Hircan&rsquo;s opinion, which is also
      mine, I pray you believe that Fortune favours the bold, and that there is
      no man loved by a lady but may at last, in whole or in part, obtain from
      her what he desires, provided he seek it with wisdom and passion. But
      ignorance and foolish fear cause men to lose many a good chance; and then
      they impute their loss to their mistress&rsquo;s virtue, which they have never
      verified with so much as the tip of the finger. A fortress was never well
      assailed but it was taken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;I am amazed that you two should dare to talk in
      this way. Those whom you have loved owe you but little thanks, or else
      your courting has been carried on in such evil places that you deem all
      women to be alike.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For myself, madam,&rdquo; said Saffredent, &ldquo;I have been so unfortunate that I
      am unable to boast; but I impute my bad luck less to the virtue of the
      ladies than to my own fault, in not conducting my enterprises with
      sufficient prudence and sagacity. In support of my opinion I will cite no
      other authority than the old woman in the <i>Romance of the Rose</i>, who
      says&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &lsquo;Of all, fair sirs, it truly may be said,
     Woman for man and man for woman&rsquo;s made.&rsquo; (3)

     3  From John de Mehun&rsquo;s continuation of the poem.&mdash;M. 2
</pre>
    <p>
      Accordingly I shall always believe that if love once enters a woman&rsquo;s
      heart, her lover will have fair fortune, provided he be not a simpleton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;if I were to name to you a very loving woman who
      was greatly sought after, beset and importuned, and who, like a virtuous
      lady, proved victorious over her heart, flesh, love and lover, would you
      believe this true thing possible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;you must all be hard of belief if you do not
      believe this story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said Dagoucin, &ldquo;since I have given an example to show how the
      love of a virtuous gentleman lasted even until death, I pray you, if you
      know any such story to the honour of a lady, to tell it to us, and so end
      this day. And be not afraid to speak at length, for there is yet time to
      relate many a pleasant matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, since I am to wind up the day,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;I will make no
      long preamble, for my story is so beautiful and true that I long to have
      you know it as well as I do myself. Although I was not an actual witness
      of the events, they were told to me by one of my best and dearest friends
      in praise of the man whom of all the world he had loved the most. But he
      charged me, should I ever chance to relate them, to change the names of
      the persons. Apart, therefore, from the names of persons and places the
      story is wholly true.&rdquo;

      <i>TALE X</i>.

    <p>
      <i>Florida, after virtuously resisting Amadour, who had assailed her
      honour almost to the last extremity, repaired, upon her husbands death, to
      the convent of Jesus, and there took the veil</i>. (1)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  This tale appears to be a combination of fact and fiction.
     Although Queen Margaret states that she has changed the
     names of the persons, and also of the places where the
     incidents happened, several historical events are certainly
     brought into the narrative, the scene of which is laid in
     Spain during the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella. M. Le Roux
     de Lincy is of opinion, however, that Margaret really refers
     to some affair at the Court of Charles VIII. or Louis XII.,
     and he remarks that there is great similarity between the
     position of the Countess of Aranda, left a widow at an early
     age with a son and a daughter, and that of Louise of Savoy
     with her two children. M. Lacroix and M. Dillaye believe the
     hero and heroine to be Admiral de Bonnivet and Margaret. It
     has often been suspected that the latter regarded her
     brother&rsquo;s favourite with affection until after the attempt
     related in Tale IV.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      In the county of Aranda, (2) in Aragon, there lived a lady who, while
      still very young, was left a widow, with a son and a daughter, by the
      Count of Aranda, the name of the daughter being Florida. This lady strove
      to bring up her children in all the virtues and qualities which beseem
      lords and gentlemen, so that her house was reputed to be one of the most
      honourable in all the Spains. She often went to Toledo, where the King of
      Spain dwelt, and when she came to Saragossa, which was not far from her
      house, she would remain a long while with the Queen and the Court, by whom
      she was held in as high esteem as any lady could be.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     2 Aranda, in the valley of the Duero, between Burgos
     and Madrid, is one of the most ancient towns in Spain, but of
     miserable aspect, although a large trade is carried on there
     in cheap red wines. (Ferdinand and Isabella resided for some
     time at Aranda.&mdash;Ed.)
</pre>
    <p>
      Going one day, according to her custom, to visit the King, then at his
      castle of La Jasserye, (3) at Saragossa, this lady passed through a
      village belonging to the Viceroy of Catalonia, (4) who, by reason of the
      great wars between the kings of France and Spain, had not been wont to
      stir from the frontier at Perpignan. But for the time being there was
      peace, so that the Viceroy and all his captains had come to do homage to
      the King. The Viceroy, learning that the Countess of Aranda was passing
      through his domain, went to meet her, not only for the sake of the ancient
      friendship he bore her, but in order to do her honour as a kinswoman of
      the King&rsquo;s.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     3  This castle is called La Jafferie in Boaistuau&rsquo;s edition
     of 1558, and several learned commentators have speculated as
     to which is the correct spelling. Not one of them seems to
     have been aware that in the immediate vicinity of Saragossa
     there still stands an old castle called El Jaferia or
     Aljaferia, which, after being the residence of the Moorish
     sovereigns, became that of the Spanish kings of Aragon. It
     has of modern times been transformed into barracks.&mdash;Ed.

     4  Henry of Aragon, Duke of Segorbe and Count of Ribagorce,
     was Viceroy of Catalonia at this period. He was called the
     Infante of Fortune, on account of his father having died
     before his birth in 1445.&mdash;B. J.
</pre>
    <p>
      Now he had in his train many honourable gentlemen, who, in the long waging
      of war, had gained such great honour and renown that all who saw them and
      consorted with them deemed themselves fortunate. Among others there was
      one named Amadour, who, although but eighteen or nineteen years old, was
      possessed of such well-assured grace and of such excellent understanding
      that he would have been chosen from a thousand to hold a public office. It
      is true that this excellence of understanding was accompanied by such rare
      and winsome beauty that none could look at him without pleasure. And if
      his comeliness was of the choicest, it was so hard pressed by his speech
      that one knew not whether to give the greatest honour to his grace, his
      beauty, or the excellence of his conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      What caused him, however, to be still more highly esteemed was his great
      daring, which was no whit diminished by his youth. He had already shown in
      many places what he could do, so that not only the Spains, but France and
      Italy also made great account of his merits. For in all the wars in which
      he had taken part he had never spared himself, and when his country was at
      peace he would go in quest of wars in foreign lands, where he was loved
      and honoured by both friend and foe.
    </p>
    <p>
      This gentleman, for the love he bore his commander, had come to the domain
      where the Countess of Aranda had arrived, and remarking the beauty and
      grace of her daughter Florida, who was then only twelve years old, he
      thought to himself that she was the fairest maiden he had ever seen, and
      that if he could win her favour it would give him greater satisfaction
      than all the wealth and pleasure he might obtain from another. After
      looking at her for a long time he resolved to love her, although his
      reason told him that what he desired was impossible by reason of her
      lineage as well as of her age, which was such that she could not yet
      understand any amorous discourse. In spite of this, he fortified himself
      with hope, and reflected that time and patience might bring his efforts to
      a happy issue. And from that moment the kindly love, which of itself alone
      had entered Amadour&rsquo;s heart, assured him of all favour and the means of
      attaining his end.
    </p>
    <p>
      To overcome the greatest difficulty before him, which consisted in the
      remoteness of his own home and the few opportunities he would have of
      seeing Florida again, he resolved to get married. This was contrary to
      what he had determined whilst with the ladies of Barcelona and Perpignan,
      in which places he was in such favour that little or nothing was refused
      him; and, indeed, by reason of the wars, he had dwelt so long on the
      frontiers that, although he was born near Toledo, he seemed rather a
      Catalan than a Castillan. He came of a rich and honourable house, but
      being a younger son, he was without patrimony; and thus it was that Love
      and Fortune, seeing him neglected by his kin, determined to make him their
      masterpiece, endowing him with such qualities as might obtain what the
      laws of the land had refused him. He was of much experience in the art of
      war, and was so beloved by all lords and princes that he refused their
      favours more frequently than he had occasion to seek them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Countess, of whom I have spoken, arrived then at Saragossa and was
      well received by the King and all his Court. The Governor of Catalonia
      often came to visit her, and Amadour failed not to accompany him that he
      might have the pleasure of merely seeing Florida, for he had no
      opportunity of speaking with her. In order to establish himself in this
      goodly company he paid his addresses to the daughter of an old knight, his
      neighbour. This maiden was named Avanturada, and was so intimate with
      Florida that she knew all the secrets of her heart. Amadour, as much for
      the worth which he found in Avanturada as for the three thousand ducats a
      year which formed her dowry, determined to address her as a suitor, and
      she willingly gave ear to him. But as he was poor and her father was rich,
      she feared that the latter would never consent to the marriage except at
      the instance of the Countess of Aranda. She therefore had recourse to the
      lady Florida and said to her&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have seen, madam, that Castilian gentleman who often talks to me. I
      believe that all his aim is to have me in marriage. You know, however,
      what kind of father I have; he will never consent to the match unless he
      be earnestly entreated by the Countess and you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Florida, who loved the damsel as herself, assured her that she would lay
      the matter to heart as though it were for her own benefit; and Avanturada
      then ventured so far as to present Amadour to her. He was like to swoon
      for joy on kissing Florida&rsquo;s hand, and although he was accounted the
      readiest speaker in Spain, yet in her presence he became dumb. At this she
      was greatly surprised, for, although she was only twelve years old, she
      had already often heard it said that there was no man in Spain who could
      speak better or with more grace. So, finding that he said nothing to her,
      she herself spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Senor Amadour,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;the renown you enjoy throughout all the
      Spains has made you known to everybody here, and all are desirous of
      affording you pleasure. If therefore I can in any way do this, you may
      dispose of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amadour was in such rapture at sight of the lady&rsquo;s beauty that he could
      scarcely utter his thanks. However, although Florida was astonished to
      find that he made no further reply, she imputed it rather to some whim
      than to the power of love; and so she withdrew, without saying anything
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amadour, who perceived the qualities which even in earliest youth were
      beginning to show themselves in Florida, now said to her whom he desired
      to marry&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not be surprised if I lost the power of utterance in presence of the
      lady Florida. I was so astonished at finding such qualities and such
      sensible speech in one so very young that I knew not what to say to her.
      But I pray you, Avanturada, you who know her secrets, tell me if she does
      not of necessity possess the hearts of all the gentlemen of the Court. Any
      who know her and do not love her must be stones or brutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Avanturada, who already loved Amadour more than any other man in the
      world, could conceal nothing from him, but told him that Florida was loved
      by every one. However, by reason of the custom of the country, few spoke
      to her, and only two had as yet made any show of love towards her. These
      were two princes of Spain, and they desired to marry her, one being the
      son of the Infante of Fortune (5) and the other the young Duke of Cardona.
      (6)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     5  M. Lacroix asserts that the Infante of Fortune left no son
     by his wife, Guyomare de Castro y Norogna; whereas M. Le
     Roux de Lincy contends that he had a son&mdash;Alfonso of Aragon&mdash;
     who in 1506 was proposed as a husband for Crazy Jane.
     Alfonso would therefore probably be the prince referred to
     by Margaret.&mdash;Ed.

     6  Cardona, a fortified town on the river Cardoner, at a few
     miles from Barcelona, was a county in the time of Ferdinand
     and Isabella, and was raised by them to the rank of a duchy
     in favour of Ramon Folch I. To-day it has between two and
     three thousand inhabitants, and is chiefly noted for its
     strongly built castillo. The young Duke spoken of by Queen
     Margaret would be Ramon Folch&rsquo;s son, who was also named
     Ramon.&mdash;B. J. and Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pray you,&rdquo; said Amadour, &ldquo;tell me which of them you think she loves the
      most.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is so discreet,&rdquo; said Avanturada, &ldquo;that on no account would she
      confess to having any wish but her mother&rsquo;s. Nevertheless, as far as can
      be judged, she likes the son of the Infante of Fortune far more than she
      likes the young Duke of Cardona. But her mother would rather have her at
      Cardona, for then she would not be so far away. I hold you for a man of
      good understanding, and, if you are so minded, you may judge of her choice
      this very day, for the son of the Infante of Fortune, who is one of the
      handsomest and most accomplished princes in Christendom, is being brought
      up at this Court. If we damsels could decide the marriage by our opinions,
      he would be sure of having the Lady Florida, for they would make the
      comeliest couple in all Spain. You must know that, although they are both
      young, she being but twelve and he but fifteen, it is now three years
      since their love for each other first began; and if you would secure her
      favour, I advise you to become his friend and follower.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amadour was well pleased to find that Florida loved something, hoping that
      in time he might gain the place not of husband but of lover. He had no
      fear in regard to her virtue, but was rather afraid lest she should be
      insensible to love. After this conversation he began to consort with the
      son of the Infante of Fortune, and readily gained his favour, being well
      skilled in all the pastimes that the young Prince was fond of, especially
      in the handling of horses, in the practice of all kinds of weapons, and
      indeed in every diversion and pastime befitting a young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, war broke out again in Languedoc, and it was necessary that
      Amadour should return thither with the Governor. This he did, but not
      without great regret, since he could in no wise contrive to return to
      where he might see Florida. Accordingly, when he was setting forth, he
      spoke to a brother of his, who was majordomo to the Queen of Spain, and
      told him of the good match he had found in the Countess of Aranda&rsquo;s house,
      in the person of Avanturada; entreating him, in his absence, to do all
      that he could to bring about the marriage, by employing his credit with
      the King, the Queen, and all his friends. The majordomo, who was attached
      to his brother, not only by reason of their kinship, but on account of
      Amadour&rsquo;s excellent qualities, promised to do his best. This he did in
      such wise that the avaricious old father forgot his own nature to ponder
      over the qualities of Amadour, as pictured to him by the Countess of
      Aranda, and especially by the fair Florida, as well as by the young Count
      of Aranda, who was now beginning to grow up, and to esteem people of
      merit. When the marriage had been agreed upon by the kinsfolk, the Queen&rsquo;s
      majordomo sent for his brother, there being at that time a truce between
      the two kings. (7)
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, the King of Spain withdrew to Madrid to avoid the bad air which
      prevailed in divers places, and, by the advice of his Council, as well as
      at the request of the Countess of Aranda, he consented to the marriage of
      the young Count with the heiress Duchess of Medina Celi. (8) He did this
      no less for their contentment and the union of the two houses than for the
      affection he bore the Countess of Aranda; and he caused the marriage to be
      celebrated at the castle of Madrid. (9)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     7  There had been a truce in 1497, but Queen Margaret
     probably alludes to that of four months&rsquo; duration towards
     the close of 1503.&mdash;B.J.

     8  Felix-Maria, widow of the Duke of Feria, and elder sister
     of Luis Francisco de la Cerda, ninth of the name. She became
     heiress to the titles and estates of the house of Medina-
     Celi upon her brother&rsquo;s death. If, however, Queen Margaret
     is really describing some incident in her own life, she must
     refer to Louis XII.&lsquo;s daughter, Claude, married in 1514 to
     Francis I.&mdash;D.

     9  The castle here referred to was the Moorish Alcazar,
     destroyed by fire in 1734. The previous statement that King
     Ferdinand withdrew to Madrid on account of the bad air
     prevailing in other places is borne out by the fact that the
     town enjoyed a most delightful climate prior to the
     destruction of the forests which surrounded it.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      Amadour was present at this wedding, and succeeded so well in furthering
      his own union, that he married Avanturada, whose affection for him was far
      greater than his was for her. But this marriage furnished him with a very
      convenient cloak, and gave him an excuse for resorting to the place where
      his spirit ever dwelt. After he was married he became very bold and
      familiar in the Countess of Aranda&rsquo;s household, so that he was no more
      distrusted than if he had been a woman. And although he was now only
      twenty-two years of age, he showed such good sense that the Countess of
      Aranda informed him of all her affairs, and bade her son consult with him
      and follow his counsel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having gained their esteem thus far, Amadour comported himself so
      prudently and calmly that even the lady he loved was not aware of his
      affection for her. By reason, however, of the love she bore his wife, to
      whom she was more attached than to any other woman, she concealed none of
      her thoughts from him, and was pleased to tell him of all her love for the
      son of the Infante of Fortune. Although Amadour&rsquo;s sole aim was to win her
      entirely for himself, he continually spoke to her of the Prince; indeed,
      he cared not what might be the subject of their converse, provided only
      that he could talk to her for a long time. However, he had not remained a
      month in this society after his marriage when he was constrained to return
      to the war, and he was absent for more than two years without returning to
      see his wife, who continued to live in the place where she had been
      brought up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Amadour often wrote to her, but his letters were for the most
      part messages to Florida, who on her side never failed to return them, and
      would with her own hand add some pleasant words to the letters which
      Avanturada wrote. It was on this account that the husband of the latter
      wrote to her very frequently; yet of all this Florida knew nothing except
      that she loved Amadour as if he had been her brother. Several times during
      the course of five years did Amadour return and go away again; yet so
      short was his stay that he did not see Florida for two months altogether.
      Nevertheless, in spite of distance and length of absence, his love
      continued to increase.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last it happened that he made a journey to see his wife, and found the
      Countess far removed from the Court, for the King of Spain was gone into
      Andalusia, (10) taking with him the young Count of Aranda, who was already
      beginning to bear arms.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     10  There had been a revolt at Granada in 1499, and in the
     following year the Moors rose in the Alpujarras, whereupon
     King Ferdinand marched against them in person.&mdash;L.
</pre>
    <p>
      Thus the Countess had withdrawn to a country-house belonging to her on the
      frontiers of Aragon and Navarre. She was well pleased on seeing Amadour,
      who had now been away for nearly three years. He was made welcome by all,
      and the Countess commanded that he should be treated like her own son.
      Whilst he was with her she informed him of all the affairs of her
      household, leaving most of them to his judgment. And so much credit did he
      win in her house that wherever he visited all doors were opened to him,
      and, indeed, people held his prudence in such high esteem that he was
      trusted in all things as though he had been an angel or a saint.
    </p>
    <p>
      Florida, by reason of the love she bore his wife and himself, sought him
      out wherever he went. She had no suspicion of his purpose, and was
      unrestrained in her manners, for her heart was free from love, save that
      she felt great contentment whenever she was near Amadour. To more than
      this she gave not a thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amadour, however, had a hard task to escape the observation of those who
      knew by experience how to distinguish a lover&rsquo;s looks from another man&rsquo;s;
      for when Florida, thinking no evil, came and spoke familiarly to him, the
      fire that was hidden in his heart so consumed him that he could not keep
      the colour from rising to his face or sparks of flame from darting from
      his eyes. Thus, in order that none might be any the wiser, he began to pay
      court to a very beautiful lady named Paulina, a woman so famed for beauty
      in her day that few men who saw her escaped from her toils.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Paulina had heard how Amadour had made love at Barcelona and
      Perpignan, insomuch that he had gained the affection of the highest and
      most beautiful ladies in the land, especially that of a certain Countess
      of Palamos, who was esteemed the first for beauty among all the ladies of
      Spain; and she told him that she greatly pitied him, since, after so much
      good fortune, he had married such an ugly wife. Amadour, who well
      understood by these words that she had a mind to supply his need, made her
      the fairest speeches he could devise, seeking to conceal the truth by
      persuading her of a falsehood. But she, being subtle and experienced in
      love, was not to be put off with mere words; and feeling sure that his
      heart was not to be satisfied with such love as she could give him, she
      suspected he wished to make her serve as a cloak, and so kept close watch
      upon his eyes. These, however, knew so well how to dissemble, that she had
      nothing to guide her but the barest suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, her observation sorely troubled Amadour; for Florida, who
      was ignorant of all these wiles, often spoke to him before Paulina in such
      a familiar fashion that he had to make wondrous efforts to compel his eyes
      to belie his heart. To avoid unpleasant consequences, he one day, while
      leaning against a window, spoke thus to Florida&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pray you, sweetheart, counsel me whether it is better for a man to
      speak or die?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Florida forthwith replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall always counsel my friends to speak and not to die. There are few
      words that cannot be mended, but life once lost can never be regained.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you promise me, then,&rdquo; said Amadour, &ldquo;that you will not be
      displeased by what I wish to tell you, nor yet alarmed at it, until you
      have heard me to the end?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say what you will,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;if you alarm me, none can reassure me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For two reasons,&rdquo; he then began, &ldquo;I have hitherto been unwilling to tell
      you of the great affection that I feel for you. First, I wished to prove
      it to you by long service, and secondly, I feared that you might deem it
      presumption in me, who am but a simple gentleman, to address myself to one
      upon whom it is not fitting that I should look. And even though I were of
      royal station like your own, your heart, in its loyalty, would suffer none
      save the son of the Infante of Fortune, who has won it, to speak to you of
      love. But just as in a great war necessity compels men to devastate their
      own possessions and to destroy their corn in the blade, that the enemy may
      derive no profit therefrom, so do I risk anticipating the fruit which I
      had hoped to gather in season, lest your enemies and mine profit by it to
      your detriment. Know, then, that from your earliest youth I have devoted
      myself to your service and have ever striven to win your favour. For this
      purpose alone I married her whom I thought you loved best, and, being
      acquainted with the love you bear to the son of the Infante of Fortune, I
      have striven to serve him and consort with him, as you yourself know. I
      have sought with all my power for everything that I thought could give you
      pleasure. You see that I have won the esteem of your mother, the Countess,
      and of your brother, the Count, and of all you love, so that I am regarded
      here, not as a dependant, but as one of the family. All my efforts for
      five years past have had no other end than that I might spend my whole
      life near you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Understand that I am not one of those who would by these means seek to
      obtain from you any favour or pleasure otherwise than virtuous. I know
      that I cannot marry you, and even if I could, I would not do so in face of
      the love you bear him whom I would fain see your husband. And as for
      loving you with a vicious love like those who hope that long service will
      bring them a reward to the dishonour of a lady, that is far from my
      purpose. I would rather see you dead than know that you were less worthy
      of being loved, or that your virtue had diminished for the sake of any
      pleasure to me. For the end and reward of my service I ask but one thing,
      namely, that you will be so faithful a mistress to me, as never to take
      your favour from me, and that you will suffer me to continue as I now am,
      trusting in me more than in any other, and accepting from me the assurance
      that if for your honour&rsquo;s sake, or for aught concerning you, you ever have
      need of a gentleman&rsquo;s life, I will gladly place mine at your disposal. You
      may be sure also that whatever I may do that is honourable and virtuous,
      will be done solely for love of you. If for the sake of ladies less worthy
      than you I have ever done anything that has been considered of account, be
      sure that, for a mistress like yourself, my enterprise will so increase,
      that things I heretofore found impossible will become very easy to me. If,
      however, you will not accept me as wholly yours, I am resolved to lay
      aside my arms and to renounce the valour which has failed to help me in my
      need. So I pray you grant me my just request, for your honour and
      conscience cannot refuse it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The maiden, hearing these unwonted words, began to change colour and to
      cast down her eyes like a woman in alarm. However, being sensible and
      discreet, she replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since you already have what you ask of me, Amadour, why make me such a
      long harangue? I fear me lest beneath your honourable words there be some
      hidden guile to deceive my ignorance and youth, and I am sorely perplexed
      what to reply. Were I to refuse the honourable love you offer, I should do
      contrary to what I have hitherto done, for I have always trusted you more
      than any other man in the world. Neither my conscience nor my honour
      oppose your request, nor yet the love I bear the son of the Infante of
      Fortune, for that is founded on marriage, to which you do not aspire. I
      know of nothing that should hinder me from answering you according to your
      desire, if it be not a fear arising from the small need you have for
      talking to me in this wise; for if what you ask is already yours, why
      speak of it so ardently?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amadour, who was at no loss for an answer, then said to her&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam, you speak very discreetly, and you honour me so greatly by the
      trust which you say you have in me, that if I were not satisfied with such
      good fortune I should be quite unworthy of it. But consider, madam, that
      he who would build an edifice to last for ever must be careful to have a
      sure and stable foundation. In the same way I, wishing to continue for
      ever in your service, must not only take care to have the means of
      remaining near to you, but also to prevent any one from knowing of the
      great affection that I bear you. Although it is honourable enough to be
      everywhere proclaimed, yet those who know nothing of lovers&rsquo; hearts often
      judge contrary to the truth, and thence come reports as mischievous as
      though they were true. I have been prompted to say this, and led to
      declare my love to you, because Paulina, feeling in her heart that I
      cannot love her, holds me in suspicion and does nought but watch my face
      wherever I may be. Hence, when you come and speak to me so familiarly in
      her presence, I am in great fear lest I should make some sign on which she
      may ground her judgment, and should so fall into that which I am anxious
      to avoid. For this reason I am lead to entreat you not to come and speak
      to me so suddenly before her or before others whom you know to be equally
      malicious, for I would rather die than have any living creature know the
      truth. Were I not so regardful of your honour, I should not have sought
      this converse with you, for I hold myself sufficiently happy in the love
      and trust you bear me, and I ask nothing more save that they may
      continue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Florida, who could not have been better pleased, began to be sensible of
      an unwonted feeling in her heart. She saw how honourable were the reasons
      which he laid before her; and she told him that virtue and honour replied
      for her, and that she granted him his request. Amadour&rsquo;s joy at this no
      true lover can doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Florida, however, gave more heed to his counsel than he desired, for she
      became timid not only in presence of Paulina but elsewhere, and ceased to
      seek him out as she had been accustomed to do. While they were thus
      separated she took Amadour&rsquo;s constant converse with Paulina in bad part,
      for, seeing that the latter was beautiful, she could not believe that
      Amadour did not love her. To beguile her sorrow she conversed continually
      with Avanturada, who was beginning to feel very jealous of her husband and
      Paulina, and often complained of them to Florida, who comforted her as
      well as she could, being herself smitten with the same disease. Amadour
      soon perceived the change in Florida&rsquo;s demeanour, and forthwith thought
      that she was keeping aloof from him not merely by his own advice, but also
      on account of some bitter fancies of her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, when they were coming from vespers at a monastery, he spoke to
      her, and asked&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What countenance is this you show me, madam?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That which I believe you desire,&rdquo; replied Florida.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon, suspecting the truth, and desiring to know whether he was
      right, he said to her&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have used my time so well, madam, that Paulina no longer has any
      suspicion of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could not do better,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;both for yourself and for me.
      While giving pleasure to yourself you bring me honour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amadour gathered from this speech that she believed he took pleasure in
      conversing with Paulina, and so great was his despair that he could not
      refrain from saying angrily to her&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In truth, madam, you begin betimes to torment your lover and pelt him
      with hard words. I do not think I ever had a more irksome task than to be
      obliged to hold converse with a lady I do not love. But since you take
      what I have done to serve you in bad part, I will never speak to her
      again, happen what may. And that I may hide my wrath as I have hidden my
      joy, I will betake me to some place in the neighbourhood, and there wait
      till your caprice has passed away. I hope, however, I shall there receive
      tidings from my captain and be called back to the war, where I will remain
      long enough to show you that nothing but yourself has kept me here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he forthwith departed without waiting for her reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Florida felt the greatest vexation and sorrow imaginable; and love,
      meeting with opposition, began to put forth its mighty strength. She
      perceived that she had been in the wrong, and wrote continually to Amadour
      entreating him to return, which he did after a few days, when his anger
      had abated.
    </p>
    <p>
      I cannot undertake to tell you minutely all that they said to each other
      in order to destroy this jealousy. But at all events he won the victory,
      and she promised him that not only would she never believe he loved
      Paulina, but that she would ever be convinced he found it an intolerable
      martyrdom to speak either to Paulina or to any one else except to do
      herself a service.
    </p>
    <p>
      When love had conquered this first suspicion, and while the two lovers
      were beginning to take fresh pleasure in conversing together, news came
      that the King of Spain was sending all his army to Salces. (11)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     11  Salces, a village about fifteen miles north of Perpignan,
     noted for its formidable fortress, still existing and
     commanding a pass through the Corbière Mountains, which in
     the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries separated France from
     Roussillon, then belonging to Spain. The French burnt the
     village and demolished the fort of Salces in 1496, but the
     latter was rebuilt by the Spaniards in the most massive
     style. The walls of the fort are 66 feet thick at the base
     and 54 feet thick at the summit. When Queen Margaret
     returned from Spain in 152,5 she reached France by the pass
     of Salces. (See vol. i. p. xlvi.).&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      Amadour, accustomed ever to be the first in battle, failed not to seize
      this opportunity of winning renown; but in truth he set forth with
      unwonted regret, both on account of the pleasure he was losing and because
      he feared that he might find a change on his return. He knew that Florida,
      who was now fifteen or sixteen years old, was sought in marriage by many
      great princes and lords, and he reflected that if she were married during
      his absence he might have no further opportunity of seeing her, unless,
      indeed, the Countess of Aranda gave her his wife, Avanturada, as a
      companion. However, by skilful management with his friends, he obtained a
      promise from both mother and daughter that wherever Florida might go after
      her marriage thither should his wife, Avanturada, accompany her. Although
      it was proposed to marry Florida in Portugal, it was nevertheless resolved
      that Avanturada should never leave her. With this assurance, yet not
      without unspeakable regret, Amadour went away and left his wife with the
      Countess.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Florida found herself alone after his departure, she set about doing
      such good and virtuous works as she hoped might win her the reputation
      that belongs to the most perfect women, and might prove her to be worthy
      of such a lover as Amadour. He having arrived at Barcelona, was there
      welcomed by the ladies as of old; but they found a greater change in him
      than they believed it possible for marriage to effect in any man. He
      seemed to be vexed by the sight of things he had formerly desired; and
      even the Countess of Palamos, whom he had loved exceedingly, could not
      persuade him to visit her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amadour remained at Barcelona as short a time as possible, for he was
      impatient to reach Salces, where he alone was now awaited. When he
      arrived, there began between the two kings that great and cruel war which
      I do not purpose to describe. (12) Neither will I recount the noble deeds
      that were done by Amadour, for then my story would take up an entire day;
      but you must know that he won renown far above all his comrades. The Duke
      of Najera (13) having arrived at Perpignan in command of two thousand men,
      requested Amadour to be his lieutenant, and so well did Amadour fulfil his
      duty with this band, that in every skirmish the only cry was &ldquo;Najera!&rdquo;
       (14)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     12  In 1503 the French, under Marshals de Rieux and de Gié,
     again besieged Salces, which had a garrison of 1200 men. The
     latter opposed a vigorous defence during two months, and
     upon the arrival of the old Duke of Alba with an army of
     succour the siege had to be raised.&mdash;B. J.

     13  Pedro Manriquez de Lara, Count of Trevigno, created Duke
     of Najera by Ferdinand and Isabella in 1501.&mdash;B. J.

     14  The Duke&rsquo;s war-cry, repeated by his followers as a
     rallying signal in the <i>mêlée</i>. War-cries varied greatly.
     &ldquo;Montjoie St. Denis&rdquo; was that of the kings of France, and
     &ldquo;Passavant le meilleur&rdquo; (the best to the front) that of the
     Counts of Champagne. In other instances the war-cry
     consisted of a single word, &ldquo;Bigorre&rdquo; being that of the
     kings of Navarre, and &ldquo;Flanders&rdquo; that of the Princess of
     Beaujeu. When the war-cry was merely a name, as in the case
     of the Duke of Najera, it belonged to the head of the
     family.&mdash;D.
</pre>
    <p>
      Now it came to pass that the King of Tunis, who for a long time had been
      at war with the Spaniards, heard that the kings of France and Spain were
      warring with each other on the frontiers of Perpignan and Narbonne, and
      bethought himself that he could have no better opportunity of vexing the
      King of Spain. Accordingly, he sent a great number of light galleys and
      other vessels to plunder and destroy all such badly-guarded places as they
      could find on the coasts of Spain. (15)The people of Barcelona seeing a
      great fleet passing in front of their town, sent word of the matter to the
      Viceroy, who was at Salces, and he forthwith despatched the Duke of Najera
      to Palamos. (16) When the Moors saw that place so well guarded, they made
      a feint of passing on; but returning at midnight, they landed a large
      number of men, and the Duke of Najera, being surprised by the enemy, was
      taken prisoner.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     15  The above two sentences, deficient in the MS. followed by
     M. Le Roux de Lincy, have been borrowed from MS. No. 1520
     (Bib. Nat.). It was in 1503 that a Moorish flotilla ravaged
     the coast of Catalonia.&mdash;Ed.

     16  The village of Palamos, on the shores of the
     Mediterranean, south of Cape Bagur, and within fifteen miles
     from Gerona.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      Amadour, who was on the alert and heard the din, forthwith assembled as
      many of his men as possible, and defended himself so stoutly that the
      enemy, in spite of their numbers, were for a long time unable to prevail
      against him. But at last, hearing that the Duke of Najera was taken, and
      that the Turks had resolved to set fire to Palamos and burn him in the
      house which he was holding against them, he thought it better to yield
      than to cause the destruction of the brave men who were with him. He also
      hoped that by paying a ransom he might yet see Florida again. Accordingly,
      he gave himself up to a Turk named Dorlin, a governor of the King of
      Tunis, who brought him to his master. By the latter he was well received
      and still better guarded; for the King deemed that in him he held the
      Achilles of all the Spains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus Amadour continued for two years in the service of the King of Tunis.
      The news of the captures having reached Spain, the kinsfolk of the Duke of
      Najera were in great sorrow; but those who held the country&rsquo;s honour dear
      deemed Amadour the greater loss. The rumour came to the house of the
      Countess of Aranda, where the hapless Avanturada at that time lay
      grievously sick. The Countess, who had great misgivings as to the
      affection which Amadour bore to her daughter, though she suffered it and
      concealed it for the sake of the merits she perceived in him, took Florida
      apart and told her the mournful tidings. Florida, who was well able to
      dissemble, replied that it was a great loss to the entire household, and
      that above all she pitied his poor wife, who was herself so ill.
      Nevertheless, seeing that her mother wept exceedingly, she shed a few
      tears to bear her company; for she feared that if she dissembled too far
      the feint might be discovered. From that time the Countess often spoke to
      her of Amadour, but never could she surprise a look to guide her judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will pass over the pilgrimages, prayers, supplications, and fasts which
      Florida regularly performed to ensure the safety of Amadour. As soon as he
      had arrived at Tunis, he failed not to send tidings of himself to his
      friends, and by a trusty messenger he apprised Florida that he was in good
      health, and had hopes of seeing her again. This was the only consolation
      the poor lady had in her grief, and you may be sure that, since she was
      permitted to write, she did so with all diligence, so that Amadour had no
      lack of her letters to comfort him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Countess of Aranda was about this time commanded to repair to
      Saragossa, where the King had arrived; and here she found the young Duke
      of Cardona, who so pressed the King and Queen that they begged the
      Countess to give him their daughter in marriage. (17) The Countess
      consented, for she was unwilling to disobey them in anything, and moreover
      she considered that her daughter, being so young, could have no will of
      her own.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     17  The Spanish historians state that in 1513 the King, to
     put an end to a quarrel between the Count of Aranda and the
     Count of Ribagorce, charged Father John of Estuniga,
     Provincial of the Order of St. Francis, to negotiate a
     reconciliation between them, based on the marriage of the
     eldest daughter of the Count of Aranda with the eldest son
     of the Count of Ribagorce. The latter refusing his consent,
     was banished from the kingdom.&mdash;D.
</pre>
    <p>
      When all was settled, she told Florida that she had chosen for her the
      match which seemed most suitable. Florida, knowing that when a thing is
      once done there is small room for counsel, replied that God was to be
      praised for all things; and, finding her mother look coldly upon her, she
      sought rather to obey her than to take pity on herself. It scarcely
      comforted her in her sorrows to learn that the son of the Infante of
      Fortune was sick even to death; but never, either in presence of her
      mother or of any one else, did she show any sign of grief. So strongly did
      she constrain herself, that her tears, driven perforce back into her
      heart, caused so great a loss of blood from the nose that her life was
      endangered; and, that she might be restored to health, she was given in
      marriage to one whom she would willingly have exchanged for death.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the marriage Florida departed with her husband to the duchy of
      Cardona, taking with her Avanturada, whom she privately acquainted with
      her sorrow, both as regards her mother&rsquo;s harshness and her own regret at
      having lost the son of the Infante of Fortune; but she never spoke of her
      regret for Amadour except to console his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      This young lady then resolved to keep God and honour before her eyes. So
      well did she conceal her grief, that none of her friends perceived that
      her husband was displeasing to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this way she spent a long time, living a life that was worse than
      death, as she failed not to inform her lover Amadour, who, knowing the
      virtue and greatness of her heart, as well as the love that she had borne
      to the son of the Infante of Fortune, thought it impossible that she could
      live long, and mourned for her as for one that was more than dead. This
      sorrow was an increase to his former grief, and forgetting his own
      distress in that which he knew his sweetheart was enduring, he would
      willingly have continued all his life the slave he was if Florida could
      thereby have had a husband after her own heart. He learnt from a friend
      whom he had gained at the Court of Tunis that the King, wishing to keep
      him if only he could make a good Turk of him, intended to give him his
      choice between impalement and the renunciation of his faith. Thereupon he
      so addressed himself to his master, the governor who had taken him
      prisoner, that he persuaded him to release him on parole. His master
      named, however, a much higher ransom than he thought could be raised by a
      man of such little wealth, and then, without speaking to the King, he let
      him go.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Amadour reached the Court of the King of Spain, he stayed there but a
      short time, and then, in order to seek his ransom among his friends, he
      repaired to Barcelona, whither the young Duke of Cardona, his mother, and
      Florida had gone on business. As soon as Avanturada heard that her husband
      was returned, she told the news to Florida, who rejoiced as though for
      love of her friend. Fearing, however, that her joy at seeing Amadour might
      make her change her countenance, and that those who did not know her might
      think wrongly of her, she remained at a window in order to see him coming
      from afar. As soon as she perceived him she went down by a dark staircase,
      so that none could see whether she changed colour, and embracing Amadour,
      led him to her room, and thence to her mother-in-law, who had never seen
      him. He had not been there for two days before he was loved as much as he
      had been in the household of the Countess of Aranda.
    </p>
    <p>
      I leave you to imagine the conversation that he and Florida had together,
      and how she complained to him of the misfortunes that had come to her in
      his absence. After shedding many tears of sorrow, both for having been
      married against her will and also for having lost one she loved so dearly
      without any hope of seeing him again, she resolved to take consolation
      from the love and trust she had towards Amadour. Though she durst not
      declare the truth, he suspected it, and lost neither time nor opportunity
      to show her how much he loved her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just when Florida was all but persuaded to receive him, not as a lover,
      but as a true and perfect friend, a misfortune came to pass, for the King
      summoned Amadour to him concerning some important matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife was so grieved on hearing these tidings that she swooned, and
      falling down a staircase on which she was standing, was so hurt that she
      never rose again. Florida having by this death lost all her consolation,
      mourned like one who felt herself bereft of friends and kin. But Amadour
      grieved still more; for on the one part he lost one of the best wives that
      ever lived, and on the other the means of ever seeing Florida again. This
      caused him such sorrow that he was near coming by a sudden death. The old
      Duchess of Cardona visited him incessantly, reciting the arguments of
      philosophers why he should endure his loss with patience. But all was of
      no avail; for if on the one hand his wife&rsquo;s death afflicted him, on the
      other his love increased his martyrdom. Having no longer any excuse to
      stay when his wife was buried, and his master again summoned him, his
      despair was such that he was like to lose his reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      Florida, who thinking to comfort him, was herself the cause of his
      greatest grief, spent a whole afternoon in the most gracious converse with
      him in order to lessen his sorrow, and assured him that she would find
      means to see him oftener than he thought. Then, as he was to depart on the
      following morning, and was so weak that he could scarcely stir from his
      bed, he prayed her to come and see him in the evening after every one else
      had left him. This she promised to do, not knowing that love in extremity
      is void of reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amadour altogether despaired of ever again seeing her whom he had loved so
      long, and from whom he had received no other treatment than I have
      described. Racked by secret passion and by despair at losing all means of
      consorting with her, he resolved to play at double or quits, and either
      lose her altogether or else wholly win her, and so pay himself in an hour
      the reward which he thought he had deserved. Accordingly he had his bed
      curtained in such a manner that those who came into the room could not see
      him; and he complained so much more than he had done previously that all
      the people of the house thought he had not twenty-four hours to live.
    </p>
    <p>
      After every one else had visited him, Florida, at the request of her
      husband himself, came in the evening, hoping to comfort him by declaring
      her affection and by telling him that, so far as honour allowed, she was
      willing to love him. She sat down on a chair beside the head of his bed,
      and began her consolation by weeping with him. Amadour, seeing her filled
      with such sorrow, thought that in her distress he might the more readily
      achieve his purpose, and raised himself up in the bed. Florida, thinking
      that he was too weak to do this, sought to prevent him, but he threw
      himself on his knees before her saying, &ldquo;Must I lose sight of you for
      ever?&rdquo; Then he fell into her arms like one exhausted. The hapless Florida
      embraced him and supported him for a long time, doing all she could to
      comfort him. But what she offered him to cure his pain only increased it;
      and while feigning to be half dead, he, without saying a word, strove to
      obtain that which the honour of ladies forbids.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Florida perceived his evil purpose, in which she could hardly believe
      after all his honourable conversation, she asked him what he sought to do.
      Amadour, fearing her reply, which he knew could not be otherwise than
      chaste and virtuous, said nothing, but pursued his attempt with all the
      strength that he could muster. Florida, greatly astonished, suspected
      rather that he had lost his senses than that he was really bent upon her
      dishonour, and called out to a gentleman whom she knew to be in the room;
      whereupon Amadour in extreme despair flung himself back upon his bed so
      suddenly that the gentleman thought him dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Florida, who had risen from her chair, then said to the gentleman&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go quickly for some strong vinegar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This the gentleman did, whereupon Florida said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What madness, Amadour, has mounted to your brain? What was it you thought
      and wished to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amadour, who had lost all reason in the vehemence of his love, replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does so long a service merit so cruel a reward?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what of the honour of which you have so often preached to me?&rdquo; said
      Florida.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! madam,&rdquo; said Amadour, &ldquo;it would be impossible to hold your honour
      more dear than I have held it. Before you were married, I was able so to
      subdue my heart that you knew nothing of my desires, but now that you are
      wedded and your honour may be shielded, do I wrong you in asking for what
      is mine? By the strength of my love I have won you. He who first possessed
      your heart had so little desire for your person that he deserved to lose
      both. He who now owns your person is not worthy to have your heart, and
      hence even your person does not properly belong to him. But for five or
      six years I have for your sake borne many pains and woes, which must show
      you that your body and heart belong to me alone. Think not to defend
      yourself by speaking of conscience, for when love constrains body and
      heart sin is never imputed. Those who are driven by frenzy so far as to
      slay themselves cannot sin, for passion leaves no room for reason; and if
      the passion of love be more intolerable than any other, and more blinding
      to the senses, what sin could you fasten upon one who yields to the
      conduct of such indomitable power? I am going away, and have no hope of
      ever seeing you again; but if before my departure I could have of you that
      assurance which the greatness of my love deserves, I should be
      strengthened sufficiently to endure in patience the sorrows of a long
      separation. If you will not grant me my request you will ere long learn
      that your harshness has brought me to a miserable and a cruel death.&rdquo; (18)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     18  The passage commencing &ldquo;Those who are driven&rdquo; and ending
     &ldquo;a cruel death&rdquo; is deficient in the earlier editions of the
     <i>Heptameron</i>, which give the following in place of it: &ldquo;Do
     not doubt but what those who have felt the power of love
     will cast the blame on you who have so robbed me of my
     liberty and dazzled my senses with your divine graces, that
     not knowing what to do henceforth, I am constrained to go
     away without the hope of ever seeing you again; certain,
     however, that wherever I may be, you will still have part of
     my heart, which will ever remain yours, be I on land, on the
     sea, or in the hands of my most cruel enemies.&rdquo; The above is
     one of various instances of the liberty taken by Boaistuau
     and Gruget with Margaret&rsquo;s text.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      Florida was not less grieved than astonished to hear these words from one
      whom she had never imagined capable of such discourse, and, weeping, she
      thus replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, Amadour, is this the honourable converse that we used to have
      together while I was young? Is this the honour or conscience which many a
      time you counselled me to value more than life? Have you forgotten both
      the worthy examples you set before me of virtuous ladies who withstood
      unholy love, and also your own contempt for erring women? I cannot believe
      you so changed, Amadour, that regard for God, your own conscience, and my
      honour is wholly dead within you. But if it indeed be as you say, I praise
      the divine goodness which has prevented the misfortune into which I was
      about to fall, and has revealed to me by your own words the heart of which
      I was so ignorant. Having lost the son of the Infante of Fortune, not only
      by my marriage, but also, as is known to me, by reason of his love for
      another, and finding myself wedded to a man whom, strive as I may, I
      cannot love, I resolved to set heart and affection entirely on loving you.
      This love I built upon that virtue which I had so often perceived in you,
      and to which by your own assistance I think I have attained&mdash;I mean
      the virtue of loving one&rsquo;s honour and conscience more than life. I came
      hither thinking to make this rock of virtue a sure foundation of love. But
      you have in a moment shown me, Amadour, that instead of a pure and cleanly
      rock, this foundation would have been one of shifting sand or filthy mire;
      and although a great part of the house in which I hoped always to dwell
      had already been raised, you have suddenly demolished it. Lay aside,
      therefore, any hope you had concerning me, and make up your mind not to
      seek me by look or word wherever I may be, or to hope that I shall ever be
      able or willing to change my resolve. It is with the deepest sorrow that I
      tell you this, though had I gone so far as to swear eternal love with you,
      I know that my heart could not have lived through this meeting. Even now I
      am so confounded to find myself deceived, that I am sure my life will be
      either short or sad. With these words I bid you farewell, and for ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I will not try to describe to you the grief that Amadour felt on hearing
      this speech. It is impossible not only to describe it, but even to
      conceive it, except indeed to such as have experienced the like. Seeing
      that with this cruel conclusion she was about to leave him, he seized her
      by the arm, knowing full well that, if he did not remove her evil opinion
      of him, he would lose her for ever. Accordingly he dissembled his looks as
      well as he could, and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;During my whole life, madam, I have desired to love a woman of virtue,
      and having found so few of them, I was minded to put you to proof, and so
      discover whether you were as well worthy of esteem as of love. Now I know
      for certain that you are; and therefore I give praise to God, who has
      inclined my heart to the love of such great perfection. I entreat you to
      pardon my mad and foolhardy attempt, seeing that the issue of it has
      turned to your honour and to my great satisfaction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Florida was beginning to learn through him the deceitfulness of men; and,
      just as she had formerly found it difficult to believe in evil where it
      existed, so did she now find it even more difficult to believe in virtue
      where there was none.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would to God you spoke the truth,&rdquo; she said to him; &ldquo;but I am not so
      ignorant as not to know by my experience in marriage that the blindness of
      strong passion led you to act as you did. Had God given me a loose rein I
      am sure that you would not have drawn bridle. Those who go in quest of
      virtue are wont to take a different road to yours. But enough; if I have
      been too hasty in crediting you with some goodness, it is time I learned
      the truth, by which I am now delivered out of your hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Florida left the room. As long as the night lasted she did
      nought but weep; for the change that had taken place caused her intense
      grief, and her heart had much ado to hold out against the sorrowing of
      love. Although, guided by reason, she had resolved to love no more, yet
      the heart, which cannot be subdued, would in no wise permit this. Thus she
      was unable to love him less than before, and knowing that love had been
      the cause of his offence, she made up her mind to satisfy love by
      continuing to love him with her whole heart, and to obey honour by never
      giving any sign of her affection either to him or to any one else.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning Amadour departed in the distress that I have described.
      Nevertheless his heart, which was so lofty that there was none like it in
      the world, suffered him not to despair, but prompted him to new devices
      for seeing Florida again and winning her favour. So as he proceeded to the
      King of Spain, who was then at Toledo, he took his way through the county
      of Aranda, where he arrived very late one evening, and found the Countess
      in great sadness on account of the absence of her daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she saw Amadour she kissed and embraced him as though he had been her
      own son, and this no less for the love she herself bore him as for that
      which she suspected he had for Florida. She asked minutely for news of her
      daughter, and he told her what he could, though not the entire truth.
      However, he confessed the love which existed between them, and which
      Florida had always concealed; and he begged the Countess to aid him in
      hearing often of Florida, and to take her as speedily as possible to
      Aranda.
    </p>
    <p>
      At daybreak he went on his way, and when he had despatched his business
      with the King he left for the war. So sad was he and so changed in every
      way that ladies, captains, and acquaintances alike could scarcely
      recognise him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He now wore nothing but black, and this of a heavier pile than was needful
      as mourning for his dead wife; but indeed her death served only as a cloak
      for the sorrow that was in his heart. Thus Amadour spent three or four
      years without returning to Court.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Countess of Aranda hearing that Florida was changed and that it was
      pitiful to see her, sent for her, hoping that she would return home. The
      contrary, however, happened. When Florida learned that Amadour had told
      her mother of their love, and that she, although so discreet and virtuous,
      had approved of it, she was in extraordinary perplexity. On the one hand
      she perceived that if her mother, who had such great esteem for Amadour,
      were told the truth some mischief might befall the latter; and this even
      to save her life she would not have brought to pass, for she felt strong
      enough to punish his folly herself without calling on her kinsfolk for
      assistance. On the other hand she saw that, if she concealed the evil she
      knew of him, she would be constrained by her mother and all her friends to
      speak to him and show him favour, and this she feared would only
      strengthen his evil purpose. However, as he was a long way off, she kept
      her own counsel, and wrote to him whenever the Countess commanded her.
      Still her letters were such that he could see they were written more out
      of obedience than goodwill; and the grief he felt in reading them was as
      great as his joy had been in reading the earlier ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of two or three years, when he had performed so many noble
      deeds that all the paper in Spain could not contain the records of them,
      (19) he conceived a very skilful device, not indeed to win Florida&rsquo;s
      heart, which he looked upon as lost, but to gain the victory over his
      enemy, since such she had shown herself to be. He put aside all the
      promptings of reason and even the fear of death, and at the risk of his
      life resolved to act in the following way. He persuaded the chief Governor
      (20) to send him on an embassy to the King concerning some secret attempt
      against Leucate; (21) and he procured a command to take counsel with the
      Countess of Aranda about the matter before communicating it to the King.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     19  Margaret, perhaps, wrote &ldquo;All the paper of Spain could
     not contain them,&rdquo; simply because Spanish paper was then of
     very small size. Paper-making had, however, been almost
     monopolised by Spain until the end of the thirteenth
     century, the cotton used in the manufacture being imported
     from the East.&mdash;M.

     20  The Viceroy of Catalonia.&mdash;D.

     21  Leucate, now a village, but said to have been a
     flourishing town in the fourteenth century, lies near the
     Mediterranean, at a few miles from Salces, and gives its
     name to a large salt-water lake. Formerly fortified, it was
     repeatedly besieged and burnt by the Spaniards; notably by
     the Duke of Alba in 1503, after he had relieved Salces.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      Then he came post haste to the county of Aranda, where he knew Florida to
      be, and secretly sent a friend to inform the Countess of his coming,
      praying her to keep it secret, and to grant him audience at nightfall
      without the knowledge of any one.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Countess, who was very pleased at his coming, spoke of it to Florida,
      and sent her to undress in her husband&rsquo;s room, that she might be ready
      when sent for after every one was gone to bed. Florida had not yet
      recovered from her first alarm, but she said nothing of it to her mother,
      and withdrew to an oratory in order to commend herself to Our Lord. While
      she was praying that her heart might be preserved from all evil affection,
      she remembered that Amadour had often praised her beauty, and that in
      spite of long illness it had not been impaired. Being, therefore, more
      willing to injure her beauty than suffer it to kindle an evil flame in the
      heart of an honourable gentleman, she took a stone which lay in the chapel
      and struck herself a grievous blow on the face so that her mouth, nose,
      and eyes were quite disfigured. Then, in order that no one might suspect
      it to be of her own doing, she let herself fall upon her face on leaving
      the chapel when summoned by the Countess, and cried out loudly. The
      Countess coming thither found her in this pitiful state, and forthwith
      caused her face to be dressed and bandaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the Countess led her to her own apartment, and begged her to go to
      her room and entertain Amadour until she herself had got rid of her
      company. This Florida did, thinking that there were others with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when she found herself alone with him, and the door closed upon her,
      she was as greatly troubled as he was pleased. He thought that, by love or
      violence, he would now have what he desired; so he spoke to her, and
      finding that she made the same reply as before, and that even to save her
      life she would not change her resolve, he was beside himself with despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before God, Florida,&rdquo; he said to her, &ldquo;your scruples shall not rob me of
      the fruits of my labour. Since love, patience, and humble entreaty are of
      no avail, I will spare no strength of mine to gain the boon, upon which
      all its existence depends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Florida saw that his eyes and countenance were altered exceedingly, so
      that his complexion, naturally the fairest in the world, was now as red as
      fire, and his look, usually so gentle and pleasant, had become as horrible
      and furious as though fierce flames were blazing in his heart and face. In
      his frenzy he seized her delicate, weak hands in his own strong, powerful
      ones; and she, finding herself in such bondage that she could neither
      defend herself nor fly, thought that her only chance was to try whether he
      had not retained some traces of his former love, for the sake of which he
      might forego his cruelty. She therefore said to him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you now look upon me, Amadour, in the light of an enemy, I entreat
      you, by that pure love which I once thought was in your heart, to hearken
      to me before you put me to torture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seeing that he became attentive, she continued&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! Amadour, what can prompt you to seek after a thing that can afford
      you no satisfaction, and thus afflict me with the profoundest grief? You
      made trial of my inclinations in the days of my youth and earliest beauty,
      and they perhaps served to excuse your passion; but I am amazed that now,
      when I am old, and ugly, and sorrow-stricken, you should seek for what you
      know you can never find. I am sure you do not doubt that my mind is as it
      used to be, and so by force alone can you obtain what you desire. If you
      observe the condition of my face, and lay aside the memory of the beauty
      that once you saw in it, you will have no inclination to draw any nearer;
      and if you still retain within you any remnants of your past love, it is
      impossible that pity will not subdue your frenzy. To this pity, which I
      have often found in you, I appeal with prayers for mercy. Suffer me to
      live in peace, and in that honour which by your own counsel I have
      resolved to preserve. But if the love you once bore me is now turned to
      hate, and you desire, in vengeance rather than in love, to make me the
      unhappiest woman alive, I protest to you that it shall not be so. You will
      force me against my will to make your evil purpose known to her who thinks
      so highly of you; and you may be sure that, when she learns it, your life
      will not be safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Amadour interrupted her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I must die,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I shall be the sooner rid of my torment. The
      disfigurement of your face, which I believe is of your own seeking, shall
      not restrain me from making you mine. Though I could have nothing but your
      bones, I would yet hold them close to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Florida saw that prayers, reasoning, and tears were alike of no
      avail, and that while he cruelly pursued his evil purpose she lacked the
      strength to resist him, she summoned the aid which she dreaded as greatly
      as death, and in a sad and piteous voice called as loudly as she could
      upon her mother. The Countess, hearing her daughter&rsquo;s cries, had grave
      misgivings of the truth, and hastened into the room with all possible
      speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amadour, who was not so ready to die as he affirmed, desisted promptly
      from his enterprise; and when the lady opened the door she found him close
      beside it, and Florida some distance from him. &ldquo;Amadour,&rdquo; said the
      Countess, &ldquo;what is the matter? Tell me the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amadour, who was never at a loss for invention, replied with a pale and
      daunted face&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! madam, what change is this in the lady Florida? I was never so
      astonished before, for, as I have told you, I thought I had a share in her
      favour; but I now see clearly that I have lost it all. While she was being
      brought up by you, she was, I think, no less discreet or virtuous than she
      is at present; however, she had then no qualms of conscience about
      speaking with any one. But now, when I sought to look at her, she would
      not suffer me to do so. When I saw this behaviour on her part I thought I
      must be dreaming, and asked her for her hand to kiss it after the manner
      of the country. This she utterly refused me. I acknowledge, madam, that
      then I acted wrongfully, and I entreat your pardon for it; for I took her
      hand, as it were by force, and kissed it. I asked nothing more of her, but
      I believe that she intends my death, for she called out to you as you
      know. Why she did this I cannot tell, unless indeed she feared that I had
      some other purpose in view. Nevertheless, madam, be this as it may, I
      confess that I am in the wrong; for although she ought to love all who are
      devoted to you, fortune wills it that I, who am of all most attached to
      her, am banished from her good graces. Still, I shall ever continue the
      same both to you and to her; and I entreat you to continue me in your good
      favour since, by no fault of my own, I have now lost hers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Countess, who partly believed and partly suspected him, went up to her
      daughter and asked&mdash;&ldquo;Why did you call me so loudly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Florida replied that she had felt afraid; and, although the Countess
      questioned her minutely on many points, she would give no other reply.
      Finding that she had escaped from her enemy she deemed him sufficiently
      punished by the failure of his attempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the Countess had had a long conversation with Amadour, she suffered
      him to speak again in her presence with Florida, to see how he would
      behave. He said but little, save that he thanked her for not having
      confessed the truth to her mother, and begged that since she had expelled
      him from her heart, she would at least allow no other to take his place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If my voice had not been my only means of defending myself,&rdquo; she replied,
      &ldquo;it would never have been heard; and from me you shall have no worse
      punishment, if you do not force me to it by troubling me again as you have
      done. Do not fear that I can ever love another; since I have not found the
      good I wished for in a heart that I considered to be the most virtuous in
      the world, I do not expect to find it in any man. This evil fortune will
      henceforth free me of all the passion that love can give.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words she bade him farewell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mother, who had been watching her face, was unable to form any
      opinion; though from that time forth she clearly saw that her daughter had
      lost all affection for Amadour. She imagined her so devoid of reason as to
      hate everything that she herself loved; and from that hour she warred with
      her in a strange way, spending seven years without speaking to her except
      in anger, all which she did at Amadour&rsquo;s request.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, on account of her mother&rsquo;s harsh treatment, Florida&rsquo;s former
      dread of being with her husband was changed into a desire of never leaving
      him. Seeing, however, that all her efforts were useless, she resolved to
      deceive Amadour, and laying aside her coldness for a day or two, she
      advised him to pay court to a lady who, she said, had been speaking of
      their love.
    </p>
    <p>
      This lady lived with the Queen of Spain, and was called Loretta. Amadour
      believed the story, and, thinking that he might in this way regain
      Florida&rsquo;s good graces, he made love to Loretta, who was the wife of a
      captain, one of the viceroys of the King of Spain. She, in her pleasure at
      having gained such a lover, showed so much elation that the affair was
      rumoured abroad. Even the Countess of Aranda, who was at Court, had
      knowledge of it, and thenceforward treated Florida less harshly than
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day Florida heard that the captain, Loretta&rsquo;s husband, had grown
      jealous, and was resolved to kill Amadour in one way or another as best he
      might. In spite of her altered treatment of Amadour, Florida did not
      desire that evil should befall him, and so she immediately informed him of
      what she had heard. He was quite ready to hark back again to his first
      love, and thereupon told her that, if she would grant him three hours of
      her conversation every day, he would never again speak to Loretta. But
      this she would not grant. &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Amadour, &ldquo;if you will not give me
      life, why prevent me from dying, unless indeed you hope to make me suffer
      more pain during life than any death could cause? But though death shun
      me, I will seek it until I find it; then only shall I have rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While they were on this footing, news came that the King of Granada (22)
      was entering upon a great war against the King of Spain. The latter,
      therefore, sent the Prince, his son, (23) to the war, and with him the
      Constable of Castille and the Duke of Alba, (24) two old and prudent
      lords. The Duke of Cardona and the Count of Aranda were unwilling to
      remain behind, and prayed the King to give them some command. This he did
      as befitted their rank, and gave them into the safe keeping of Amadour,
      who performed such extraordinary deeds during the war, that they seemed to
      be acts as much of despair as of bravery.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     22  The last King of Granada was Mahomed Boabdil, dethroned
     in 1493. The title may have been assumed, however, by the
     leader of an insurrection.&mdash;D.

     23  As Ferdinand and Isabella had no son, the reference must
     be to their daughter&rsquo;s husband, Philip the Fair of Austria,
     son of the Emperor Maximilian I. and father of Charles V.&mdash;
     B. J.

     24  Frederick of Toledo, Marquis of Coria and Duke of Alba,
     generally called the old Duke of Alba to distinguish him
     from his son.&mdash;B. J.
</pre>
    <p>
      Coming now to the point of my story, I have to relate how his overboldness
      was proved by his death. The Moors had made a show of offering battle, and
      finding the Christian army very numerous had feigned a retreat. The
      Spaniards started in pursuit, but the old Constable and the Duke of Alba,
      who suspected the trickery of the Moors, restrained the Prince of Spain
      against his will from crossing the river. The Count of Aranda, however,
      and the Duke of Cardona crossed, although it was forbidden; and when the
      Moors saw that they were pursued by only a few men they faced about again.
      The Duke of Cardona was struck down and killed with a blow of a scimitar,
      and the Count of Aranda was so grievously wounded that he was left for
      dead. Thereupon Amadour came up filled with rage and fury, and bursting
      through the throng, caused the two bodies to be taken up and carried to
      the camp of the Prince, who mourned for them as for his own brothers. On
      examining their wounds the Count of Aranda was found to be still alive,
      and was sent in a litter to his home, where he lay ill for a long time. On
      the other hand, the Duke&rsquo;s body was sent back to Cardona.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Amadour, having made this effort to rescue the two bodies, had
      thought so little of his own safety that he found himself surrounded by a
      large number of Moors. Not desiring his person to be captured any more
      than he had captured that of his mistress, nor to break his faith with God
      as he had broken faith with her&mdash;for he knew that, if he were taken
      to the King of Granada, he must either die a cruel death or renounce
      Christianity&mdash;he resolved to withhold from his enemies the glory
      either of his death or capture. So kissing the cross of his sword and
      commending his body and soul to God, he dealt himself such a thrust as to
      be past all help.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus died the unhappy Amadour, lamented as deeply as his virtues deserved.
      The news spread through the whole of Spain; and the rumour of it came to
      Florida, who was at Barcelona, where her husband had formerly commanded
      that he should be buried. She gave him an honourable funeral, (25) and
      then, without saying anything to her mother or mother-in-law, she became a
      nun in the Convent of Jesus, taking for husband and lover Him who had
      delivered her from such a violent love as that of Amadour&rsquo;s, and from such
      great affliction as she had endured in the company of her husband. Thus
      were all her affections directed to the perfect loving of God; and, after
      living for a long time as a nun, she yielded up her soul with gladness,
      like that of the bride when she goes forth to meet the bridegroom.

     25  The Franciscan monastery of the little village cf
     Bellpuig, near Lerida, contains the tomb of Ramon de
     Cardona, termed one of the marvels of Catalonia on account
     of the admirable sculptures adorning it. One of the
     beautiful white marble bas-reliefs shows a number of galleys
     drawn up in line of battle, whilst some smaller boats are
     conveying parties of armed men to a river-bank on which the
     Moors are awaiting them in hostile array. On the frieze of
     an arch the Spaniards and Moors are shown fighting, many of
     the former retreating towards the water. An inscription
     records that the tomb was raised to the best of husbands by
     Isabella, his unhappy spouse.

     Margaret gives the name of Florida to the wife of the Duke
     whom she mentions, but it should be borne in mind that she
     has systematically mingled fact with fiction throughout this
     story; and that she was alluding to the Duke buried at
     Bellpuig seems evident from an examination of the bas-
     reliefs mentioned above. Ramon de Cardona was, however, a
     more important personage than she pictures him. He became
     Charles V.&lsquo;s viceroy in Naples, and did not die till 1520,
     whereas Margaret&rsquo;s story appears to end in or about 1513.
     Possibly she saw the tomb when in Spain.&mdash;Ed.

      &ldquo;I am well aware, ladies, that this long tale may have been wearisome to
      some among you, but had I told it as it was told to me it would have been
      longer still. Take example, I beg you, by the virtue of Florida, but be
      somewhat less cruel; and think not so well of any man that, when you are
      undeceived, you occasion him a cruel death and yourselves a life of
      sorrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having had a long and fair hearing Parlamente said to Hircan&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you not think that this lady was pressed to extremities and that she
      held out virtuously?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Hircan; &ldquo;a woman can make no more feeble resistance than to cry
      out. If she had been in a place where none could hear her I do not know
      how she would have fared. And if Amadour had had more love and less fear
      he would not have desisted from his attempt for so little. So this story
      will not cause me to change my firm opinion that no man ever perfectly
      loved a lady, or was loved by her, that he did not prove successful if
      only he went the right way to work. Nevertheless, I must praise Amadour
      for having in part done his duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What duty?&rdquo; asked Oisille. &ldquo;Do you call it a lover&rsquo;s duty to try and take
      his mistress by force when he owes her all reverence and submission?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Saffredent took up the discourse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;when our mistresses hold their state in chamber or
      hall, seated at their ease as though they were our judges, we lead them to
      the dance in fear; we wait upon them with all diligence and anticipate
      their commands; and we are so afraid of offending them and so desirous of
      doing them service that those who see us pity us, and often deem us more
      witless than brutes. They account us dull and void of understanding, and
      give praise to the ladies, whose faces are so imperious and their speech
      so fair that they make themselves feared, loved, and honoured by those who
      only know them outwardly. But when we are together in private, and love
      alone can judge our behaviour, we know full well that they are women and
      we are men. Then is the name &lsquo;mistress&rsquo; changed to &lsquo;sweetheart,&rsquo; and the
      &lsquo;slave&rsquo; becomes a &lsquo;lover.&rsquo; As the proverb says&mdash;&lsquo;By service true and
      loyalty, do servants rise to mastery.&rsquo; They have honour equally with men,
      who can give it to them and can take it away; and seeing us suffer in
      patience, they should reward us when they can do so without hurt to their
      honour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not speak of that true honour,&rdquo; said Longarine, &ldquo;which is the
      greatest happiness this world can give. If every one calls me a virtuous
      woman, and I myself know the contrary, the praise I receive only increases
      my shame and puts me in secret to still greater confusion. In the same
      way, if people condemn me and I know that I am innocent, their
      condemnation will only make me the better pleased with myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In spite of what you all have said,&rdquo; interposed Geburon, &ldquo;it seems to me
      that Amadour was as noble and virtuous a knight as ever lived, and I think
      I can recognise him under his feigned name. Since Parlamente would not
      name him, neither will I. But you may rest assured that, if he be the man
      whom I have in mind, his heart never knew fear, nor was ever void of love
      and bravery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The day has been spent so pleasantly,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;that if the others
      are like it I think our talk will make the time pass quickly by. But see
      where the sun is, and listen to the abbey bell, which has long been
      calling us to vespers. I did not mention this to you before, for I was
      more inclined to hear the end of the story than to go to prayers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At these words they all rose, and when they reached the abbey they found
      that the monks had been waiting for them a full hour and more. After
      vespers they went to supper, and during the whole evening they conversed
      about the stories they had heard, all of them searching every corner of
      their memories to try and make the second day as pleasant as the first.
      And after playing many games in the meadow they went to bed, and so made a
      glad and happy ending of the first day.

    <p>
      On the morrow they rose in great eagerness to return to the place where
      they had had so much pleasure on the previous day. Each one was ready with
      a tale, and was impatient for the telling of it. They listened to the
      reading of Madame Oisille, and then heard mass, all commending themselves
      to God, and praying Him to grant them speech and grace for the continuance
      of their fellowship. Afterwards they went to dinner, reminding one another
      the while of many stories of the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner, they rested in their apartments, and at the appointed time
      returned to the meadow, where day and season alike seemed favourable to
      their plans. They all sat down on the natural seat afforded by the green
      sward, and Parlamente said&mdash;

      &ldquo;Yesterday I told the tenth and last tale; it is therefore for me to

      youngest&mdash;I do not also say the flightiest&mdash;for I am sure that
      if we all follow her leading we shall not delay vespers so long as we did
      yesterday. Wherefore, Nomerfide, you shall lead us, but I beg that you
      will not cause us to begin our second day in tears.&rdquo;

      <i>TALE XI.</i> (A).
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>Madame de Roncex, while at the monastery of the Grey Friars
     at Thouars, (1) was constrained to go in great haste to a
     certain place, and, not looking to see whether the seats
     were clean, sat down in a filthy spot and befouled both her
     person and clothes; whereupon crying out for assistance, in
     the hope that some woman would come and cleanse her, she was
     waited on by men, who beheld her in the worst plight in
     which a woman could be found</i>. (2)

     1  In the department of the Deux-Sèvres.&mdash;Ed.

     2  This story, given in Boaistuau&rsquo;s version of Margaret&rsquo;s
     tales, and to be found in most of the MS. copies of the
     <i>Heptameron</i> at the &lsquo;Paris Bibliothèque Nationale&rsquo;, was not
     included in the edition issued by Gruget, who replaced it by
     a story called <i>The jests made by a Grey Friar</i>, for which
     see <i>post</i>, p. 95 <i>et seq</i>.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      In the household of Madame de la Trémoille there was a lady named Roncex,
      who one day, when her mistress had gone to visit the monastery of the Grey
      Friars, found herself in great need to go to a certain place whither her
      maid could not go in her stead. She took with her a girl named La Mothe to
      keep her company, but being modest and unwilling to be seen, left her in
      the room, and went alone into a darksome privy, a place used in common by
      all the friars, who had given such a good account therein of all their
      victuals, that seat and floor, and in sooth the whole place, were thickly
      covered with the must of Bacchus and Ceres that had passed through the
      friars&rsquo; bellies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The unhappy lady, who was so hard pressed that she had scarcely time to
      lift her dress, chanced to sit down in the foulest, dirtiest spot in the
      whole place, where she found herself stuck fast as though with glue, her
      poor hips, garments, and feet being so contaminated that she durst not
      take a step or turn on any side, for fear lest she should meet with
      something worse. Thereupon she began to call out as loudly as she could&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;La Mothe, my child, I am ruined and undone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The poor girl, who had formerly heard tell of the wickedness of the Grey
      Friars, and imagined that some of them were hidden there and were trying
      to take her mistress by force, thereupon ran off as hard as she could,
      saying to every one she met&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come and help Madame de Roncex; the Grey Friars are trying to ravish her
      in yonder privy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They thereupon hastened thither with all speed, and found the unhappy lady
      crying out for assistance, longing for some woman to come and cleanse her,
      and with her back parts all uncovered, for she feared to touch them with
      her garments lest these also should be defiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentlemen, coming in at her cries, beheld this fine sight, but could
      see nought of the Grey Friars, unless it were their ordure clinging to her
      hips; nor did this pass without laughter on their part and great shame on
      hers, for instead of having women to cleanse her, she was waited on by
      men, who saw her naked, and in the sorriest plight in which a woman could
      be found. For this reason, on perceiving them, she soiled what was still
      clean, by dropping her garments in order to cover herself, forgetting the
      filth that she was in for the shame she felt at sight of the men. And when
      she had come out of that foul place it was necessary to strip her naked
      and change all her garments before she could leave the monastery. She was
      minded to be angry with La Mothe for the aid that she had brought her, but
      finding that the poor girl had thought her in a yet more evil plight, she
      put aside her wrath and laughed like the rest. (3)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     3  It is impossible to identify the lady mentioned in this
     story, her name being spelt in so many ways in the various
     MSS. of the <i>Heptameron</i>. It is given as Roncex in the copy
     here followed, as Roubex in a copy that belonged to Louis
     XVIII., and as Roncci in the De Thou MS., whilst Boaistuau
     printed it as Roucey. The Madame de la Trémoille, alluded to
     at the outset, is believed by Lacroix and Dillaye to have
     been Anne de Laval (daughter of Guy XV., Count of Laval, and
     of Charlotte of Aragon, Princess of Tarento), who married
     Francis de la Trémoille, Viscount of Thouars, in 1521, and
     was by her mother a cousin of Queen Margaret. Possibly,
     however, the reference is to Gabrielle de Bourbon, wife of
     Louis II. de la Trémoille, a lady of exemplary piety, who
     erected the beautiful Renaissance chapel of the château of
     Thouars.&mdash;L. &amp; Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, ladies,&rdquo; said Nomerfide, &ldquo;that this story has proved neither
      long nor melancholy, and that I have given you what you expected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this the company laughed heartily, and Oisille said&mdash;&ldquo;The story is
      indeed nasty and unclean, yet, knowing the persons who fared in this
      manner, we cannot consider it unwelcome. Gladly would I have seen the
      faces of La Mothe and of the lady to whom she brought such timely aid. But
      now,&rdquo; she added to Nomerfide, &ldquo;since you have finished so soon, give your
      vote to some one whose thoughts are of a graver turn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since you desire me to atone for my fault,&rdquo; answered Nomerfide, &ldquo;I give
      my vote to Dagoucin, whose discretion is such that he would die rather
      than say anything foolish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dagoucin then thanked her for the esteem in which she held his good sense,
      and thus began&mdash;&ldquo;The story I am minded to relate is intended to show
      you how love blinds the greatest and most honourable hearts, and how hard
      it is to overcome wickedness by any kindness whatsoever.&rdquo;

      <i>TALE XI.</i> (B).
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>Of the jests made by a Grey Friar in his sermons</i>. (1)

     1  See <i>ante</i>, p. 89, note 2, <i>and post</i>. Appendix B.
</pre>
    <p>
      Near the town of Bléré in Touraine there is a village called St.
      Martin-le-Beau, whither a Grey Friar belonging to the monastery at Tours
      was summoned to preach during the seasons of Advent and Lent. This friar,
      who was more garrulous than learned, and now and then found himself at a
      loss for matter to eke out his hour, would thereupon begin telling tales
      which more or less agreeably satisfied the good villagers.
    </p>
    <p>
      One Holy Thursday he preached about the Paschal Lamb, and while speaking
      of how it was eaten at night, seeing that there were present at the
      preaching some handsome young ladies of Amboise, who were newly arrived to
      keep Easter at the village, and to stay there for a few days afterwards,
      he wished to surpass himself, and thereupon asked all the women-folk
      whether they knew what it was to eat raw flesh at night. &ldquo;I will tell you
      what it is, ladies,&rdquo; he said, whereat the young men of Amboise, who had
      just arrived with their wives, sisters, and nieces, and who had no
      knowledge of the pilgrim&rsquo;s humour, began to be scandalised; though on
      listening further their indignation gave place to laughter, even when he
      said that to eat the lamb it was needful to have one&rsquo;s loins girt, one&rsquo;s
      feet in one&rsquo;s shoes, and one&rsquo;s hand on one&rsquo;s staff.
    </p>
    <p>
      The friar, seeing them laugh at this, and guessing the reason, immediately
      corrected himself. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to have shoes on one&rsquo;s feet and a
      staff in one&rsquo;s hand; &lsquo;tis all one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That this sally was received with laughter you will readily believe. Even
      the ladies could not refrain from merriment, and for them he added other
      diverting sayings. Then finding the time was nearly up, and wishing the
      ladies to be well pleased with him when they departed, he said to them&mdash;&ldquo;Now,
      fair ladies, when you are chatting presently with your gossips, you will
      be asking one another: &lsquo;Who, pray, is this Master Friar, that speaks out
      so boldly? He must be a brisk fellow.&rsquo; I will tell you, ladies, yes, I
      will tell you, and be not astonished if I speak out boldly, for I am of
      Anjou, at your service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words he ended his sermon, leaving his hearers more disposed to
      laugh at his foolish speeches than to weep in memory of our Lord&rsquo;s Passion
      which was then being commemorated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other sermons that he preached during the festival had much the same
      value. You are aware that these friars never fail to go begging for their
      Easter eggs, and receive not only eggs, but many other things, such as
      linen, yarn, chitterlings, hams, chines, and similar trifles. So when
      Easter Tuesday came, and the friar was making those exhortations to
      charity of which such folks as he are no niggards, he said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am bound to thank you, ladies, for the liberality you have shown to our
      poor monastery, and yet I cannot forbear telling you that you have
      hitherto not duly considered the nature of our wants. You have for the
      most part given us chitterlings, but of these we ourselves have no lack.
      God be praised, our monastery is indeed full of them. What then can we do
      with so many? I will tell you. My advice, ladies, is that you should mix
      your hams with our chitterlings; in this way you would bestow fine alms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, continuing his sermon, he brought into it certain scandalous matter,
      and, whilst discoursing upon it somewhat bluntly and quoting sundry
      examples, he said in apparent amazement&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truly, ladies and gentlemen of Saint-Martin, I am greatly astonished that
      you should be scandalised so unreasonably at what is less than nothing,
      and should tell tales of me wherever you go, saying: &lsquo;It is a big
      business; who could have thought that the father would have got his
      landlady&rsquo;s daughter with child?&rsquo; A monk get a girl with child!&rdquo; he
      continued; &ldquo;forsooth, what a wonder! But hark you, fair ladies, would you
      not rather have had cause for wonderment, had the girl acted thus by the
      monk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such, ladies, was the wholesome food on which this worshipful shepherd
      fed the Lord&rsquo;s flock. And so brazen was he, that after committing the sin,
      he spake openly of it in the pulpit, where nought should be said that
      tends to aught but the edification of one&rsquo;s neighbour, and above all to
      the glory of God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; said Saffredent, &ldquo;he was a master monk&mdash;I should have liked
      him nearly as well as Brother Anjibaut, who gets credit for all the jests
      that are spoken in merry company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my part, I can see nothing laughable in such mockery,&rdquo; said Oisille,
      &ldquo;especially in such a place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget, madam,&rdquo; said Nomerfide, &ldquo;that at that time, though it was not
      so very long ago, the good villagers, and indeed most of the dwellers in
      the large towns, who think themselves cleverer than other people, had
      greater regard for such preachers as he than for those who purely and
      simply preached the holy Gospel to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However that may be,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;he was not wrong in asking for hams
      in exchange for chitterlings, for in hams there is far more eating. And
      even if some devout creature had understood him amphibologically, as I
      believe he wished to be understood, neither he nor his brethren would have
      fared badly any more than the wench that had her bag full.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how impudent of him,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;to pervert the meaning of the
      text to suit his fancy, thinking that he had to do with beasts like
      himself, and shamelessly trying to entice the poor little women so that he
      might teach them how to eat raw flesh at night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Simontault; &ldquo;but you forget that he saw before him those
      young tripe-sellers of Amboise in whose tub he would fain have washed his
      &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; shall I name it? No, but you understand me&mdash;and
      have treated them to a taste of it, not roasted, but stirring and
      frisking, so as to please them the more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Softly, softly, Simontault,&rdquo; said Parlamente; &ldquo;you forget yourself. Have
      you laid aside your accustomed modesty to don it only in time of
      necessity?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, madam, no,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;&lsquo;twas the unworthy monk that led me astray.
      Wherefore, that we may return to the matter in hand, I beg Nomerfide, who
      caused my offence, to give her vote to some one who will make the company
      forget our common fault.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since you include me in your transgression,&rdquo; said Nomerfide, &ldquo;I will
      choose one who will atone for our failings, that is Dagoucin. He is so
      discreet that to save his life he would not say a foolish thing.&rdquo;

      <i>TALE XII</i>.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>The Duke of Florence, having continually failed to make
     known to a certain lady the love he bore her, confided in
     her brother, and begged his assistance that he might attain
     his ends. This, after many remonstrances, the brother agreed
     to give, but it was a lip-promise only, for at the moment
     when the Duke was expecting to vanquish her whom he had
     deemed invincible, the gentleman slew him in his bed, in
     this fashion freeing his country from a tyrant, and saving
     both his own life and the honour of his house</i>. (1)

     1  The basis of this story is historical. The event here
     described&mdash;one of the most famous in the annals of
     Florence&mdash;furnished Alfred de Musset with the subject of his
     play <i>Lorenzaccio</i>, and served as the foundation of <i>The
     Traitor</i>, considered to be Shirley&rsquo;s highest achievement as
     a dramatic poet. As Queen Margaret&rsquo;s narrative contains
     various errors of fact, Sismondi&rsquo;s account of the affair, as
     borrowed by him from the best Italian historians, is given
     in the Appendix, C&mdash;Eu.
</pre>
    <p>
      Ten years ago there reigned in the city of Florence a Duke of the house of
      Medici who had married the Emperor&rsquo;s natural daughter, Margaret. (2) She
      was still so young that the marriage could not be lawfully consummated,
      and, waiting till she should be of a riper age, the Duke treated her with
      great gentleness, and to spare her, made love to various ladies of the
      city, whom he was wont to visit at night, whilst his wife was sleeping.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     2  The Duke here referred to was Alexander de&rsquo; Medici, first
     Duke of Florence, in which city he was born in 1510. His
     mother, a slave named Anna, was the wife of a Florentine
     coachman, but Lorenzo II. de&rsquo; Medici, one of this woman&rsquo;s
     lovers, acknowledged him as his offspring, though, according
     to some accounts, his real father was one of the popes,
     Clement VII. or Julius II. After the Emperor Charles V. had
     made himself master of Florence in 1530, he confided the
     governorship of the city to Alexander, upon whom he bestowed
     the title of Duke. Two years later Alexander threw off the
     imperial control, and soon afterwards embarked on a career
     of debauchery and crime. In 1536, Charles V., being desirous
     of obtaining the support of Florence against France, treated
     with Alexander, and gave him the hand of his illegitimate
     daughter, Margaret. The latter&mdash;whose mother was Margaret
     van Gheenst, a Flemish damsel of noble birth&mdash;was at that
     time barely fourteen, having been born at Brussels in 1522.
     The Queen of Navarre&rsquo;s statements concerning the
     youthfulness of the Duchess are thus corroborated by fact.
     After the death of Alexander de&rsquo; Medici, his widow was
     married to Octavius Farnese, Duke of Parma, who was then
     only twelve years old, but by whom she eventually became the
     mother of the celebrated Alexander Farnese. Margaret of
     Austria occupies a prominent place in the history of the
     Netherlands, which she governed during a lengthy period for
     her brother Philip II. She died in retirement at Ortonna in
     Italy in 1586.&mdash;L. and Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      Among these there was one very beautiful, discreet, and honourable lady,
      sister to a gentleman whom the Duke loved even as himself, and to whom he
      gave such authority in his household that his orders were feared and
      obeyed equally with the Duke&rsquo;s own. And moreover the Duke had no secrets
      that he did not share with this gentleman, so that the latter might have
      been called his second-self. (3)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     3  The gentleman here mentioned was the Duke&rsquo;s cousin,
     Lorenzo di Pier-Francesco de&rsquo; Medici, commonly called
     Lorenzino on account of his short stature. He was born at
     Florence in 1514, and, being the eldest member of the junior
     branch of the Medici family, it had been decided by the
     Emperor Charles V. that he should succeed to the Dukedom of
     Florence, if Alexander died without issue. Lorenzino
     cultivated letters, and is said to have possessed
     considerable wit, but, on the other hand, instead of being a
     high-minded man, as Queen Margaret pictures him, he was a
     thorough profligate, and willingly lent a hand in
     Alexander&rsquo;s scandalous amours. The heroine of this story is
     erroneously described as Lorenzino&rsquo;s sister; in point of
     fact she was his aunt, Catherine Ginori. See Appendix, C.&mdash;
     Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      Finding the gentleman&rsquo;s sister to be a lady of such exemplary virtue that
      he was unable to declare his passion to her, though he sought all possible
      opportunities for doing so, the Duke at last came to his favourite and
      said to him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there were anything in this world, my friend, that I might be
      unwilling to do for you, I should hesitate to tell you what is in my mind,
      and still more to beg your assistance. But such is the affection I bear
      you that had I wife, mother, or daughter who could avail to save your
      life, I would sacrifice them rather than allow you to die in torment. I
      believe that your love for me is the counterpart of mine for you, and that
      if I, who am your master, bear you so much affection, you, on your part,
      can have no less for me. I will therefore tell you a secret, the keeping
      of which has brought me to the condition you see. I have no hope of any
      improvement except it be through death or else the service which you are
      in a position to render me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On hearing these words from the Duke, and seeing his face unfeignedly
      bathed in tears, the gentleman felt such great pity for him that he said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, I am your creature: all the wealth and honour that I am possessed of
      in this world come from you. You may speak to me as to your own soul, in
      the certainty that all that it be in my power to do is at your command.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon the Duke began to tell him of the love he bore his sister, a
      love so deep and strong that he feared he could not live much longer
      unless, by the gentleman&rsquo;s help, he succeeded in satisfying his desire. He
      was well aware that neither prayers nor presents would be of any avail
      with the lady, wherefore he begged the gentleman&mdash;if he cared for his
      master&rsquo;s life as much as he, his master, cared for his&mdash;to devise
      some means of procuring him the good fortune which, without such
      assistance, he could never hope to obtain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The brother, who loved his sister and the honour of his house far more
      than the Duke&rsquo;s pleasure, endeavoured to remonstrate with him, entreating
      that he might be employed for any other purpose save the cruel task of
      soliciting the dishonour of his own kin, and declaring that the rendering
      of such a service was contrary alike to his inclinations and his honour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inflamed with excessive wrath, the Duke raised his hand to his mouth and
      bit his nails.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he in a fury, &ldquo;since I find that you have no friendship for
      me, I know what I have to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman, who was acquainted with his master&rsquo;s cruelty, felt afraid,
      and answered&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord, since such is your pleasure, I will speak to her, and tell you
      her reply.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you show concern for my life, I shall show it for yours,&rdquo; replied the
      Duke, and thereupon he went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman well understood the meaning of these words, and spent a day
      or two without seeing the Duke, considering what he should do. On the one
      hand he was confronted by the duty he owed his master, and the wealth and
      honours he had received from him; on the other by the honour of his house,
      and the fair fame and chastity of his sister. He well knew that she would
      never submit to such infamy unless through his own treachery she were
      overcome by violence, so unnatural a deed that if it were committed he and
      his kindred would be disgraced for ever. In this dilemma he decided that
      he would sooner die than so ill use his sister, who was one of the noblest
      women in all Italy, and ought rather to deliver his country of this tyrant
      who, abusing his power, sought to cast such a slur upon his family; for he
      felt sure that if the Duke were suffered to live, neither his own life nor
      the lives of his kindred would be safe. So without speaking of the matter
      to his sister or to any living creature, he determined to save his life
      and vindicate his honour at one and the same time. Accordingly, when a
      couple of days had gone by, he went to the Duke and told him that with
      infinite difficulty he had so wrought upon his sister that she had at last
      consented to do his will, provided that the matter were kept secret, and
      none but he, her brother, knew of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke, who was longing for these tidings, readily believed them, and
      embracing the ambassador, promised him anything that he might ask. He
      begged him to put his scheme quickly into execution, and they agreed
      together upon the time when this should be done. The Duke was in great
      joy, as may well be imagined; and on the arrival of that wished-for night
      when he hoped to vanquish her whom he had deemed invincible, he retired
      early, accompanied only by the lady&rsquo;s brother, and failed not to attire
      himself in a perfumed shirt and head-gear. Then, when every one was gone
      to rest, he went with the gentleman to the lady&rsquo;s abode, where he was
      conducted into a well-appointed apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having undressed him and put him to bed, the gentleman said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord, I will now go and fetch you one who will assuredly not enter
      this room without blushing; but I hope that before morning she will have
      lost all fear of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leaving the Duke, he then went to his own room, where he found one of his
      servants, to whom he said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you brave enough to follow me to a place where I desire to avenge
      myself upon my greatest living enemy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other, who was ignorant of his master&rsquo;s purpose, replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, though it were the Duke himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon the gentleman led him away in such haste as to leave him no time
      to take any weapon except a poignard that he was wearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke, on hearing the gentleman coming back again, thought that he was
      bringing the loved one with him, and, opening his eyes, drew back the
      curtains in order to see and welcome the joy for which he had so long been
      waiting. But instead of seeing her who, so he hoped, was to preserve his
      life, he beheld something intended to take his life away, that is, a naked
      sword which the gentleman had drawn, and with which he smote the Duke. The
      latter was wearing nothing but his shirt, and lacked weapons, though not
      courage, for sitting up in the bed he seized the gentleman round the body,
      saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this the way you keep your promise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, armed as he was only with his teeth and nails, he bit the
      gentleman&rsquo;s thumb, and wrestled with him so stoutly that they both fell
      down beside the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman, not feeling altogether confident, called to his servant,
      who, finding the Duke and his master so closely twined together that he
      could not tell the one from the other, dragged them both by the feet into
      the middle of the room, and then tried to cut the Duke&rsquo;s throat with his
      poignard. The Duke defended himself until he was so exhausted through loss
      of blood that he could do no more, whereupon the gentleman and his servant
      lifted him upon the bed and finished him with their daggers. They then
      drew the curtain and went away, leaving the dead body shut up in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having vanquished his great enemy, by whose death he hoped to free his
      country, the gentleman reflected that his work would be incomplete unless
      he treated five or six of the Duke&rsquo;s kindred in the same fashion. The
      servant, however, who was neither a dare-devil nor a fool, said to him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, sir, that you have done enough for the present, and that it
      would be better to think of saving your own life than of taking the lives
      of others, for should we be as long in making away with each of them as we
      were in the case of the Duke, daylight would overtake our enterprise
      before we could complete it, even should we find our enemies unarmed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cowed by his guilty conscience, the gentleman followed the advice of his
      servant, and taking him alone with him, repaired to a Bishop (4) whose
      office it was to have the city gates opened, and to give orders to the
      guard-posts.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     4  Probably Cardinal Cybo, Alexander&rsquo;s chief minister, who
     according to Sismondi, was the first to discover the
     murder.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have,&rdquo; said the gentleman to the Bishop, &ldquo;this evening received tidings
      that one of my brothers is at the point of death. I have just asked leave
      of the Duke to go to him, and he has granted it me; and I beg you to send
      orders that the guards may furnish me with two good horses, and that the
      gatekeeper may let me through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Bishop, who regarded the gentleman&rsquo;s request in the same light as an
      order from his master the Duke, forthwith gave him a note, by means of
      which the gate was opened for him, and horses supplied to him as he had
      requested; but instead of going to see his brother he betook himself
      straight to Venice, where he had himself cured of the bites that he had
      received from the Duke, and then passed over into Turkey. (5)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     5  On leaving Florence, Lorenzo repaired first to Bologna
     and then to Venice, where he informed Philip Strozzi of how
     he had rid his country of the tyrant. After embracing him in
     a transport, and calling him the Tuscan Brutus, Strozzi
     asked the murderer&rsquo;s sisters, Laudamina and Magdalen de&rsquo;
     Medici, in marriage for his own sons, Peter and Robert. From
     Venice Lorenzino issued a <i>mémoire justificatif</i>, full of
     quibbles and paradoxes, in which he tried to explain his
     lack of energy after the murder by the indifference shown by
     the Florentines. He took no part in the various enterprises
     directed against Cosmo de&rsquo; Medici, who had succeeded
     Alexander at Florence. Indeed his chief concern was for his
     own safety, which was threatened alike by Cosmo and the
     Emperor Charles V., and to escape their emissaries he
     proceeded to Turkey, and thence to France, ultimately
     returning to Venice, where, despite all his precautions
     against danger, he was assassinated in 1547, together with
     his uncle, Soderini, by some spadassins in the pay of Cosmo
     I.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      In the morning, finding that their master delayed his return so long, all
      the Duke&rsquo;s servants suspected, rightly enough, that he had gone to see
      some lady; but at last, as he still failed to return, they began seeking
      him on all sides. The poor Duchess, who was beginning to love him dearly,
      was sorely distressed on learning that he could not be found; and as the
      gentleman to whom he bore so much affection was likewise nowhere to be
      seen, some went to his house in quest of him. They found blood on the
      threshold of the gentleman&rsquo;s room, which they entered, but he was not
      there, nor could any servant or other person give any tidings of him.
      Following the blood-stains, however, the Duke&rsquo;s servants came at last to
      the room in which their master lay. The door of it was locked, but this
      they soon broke open, and on seeing the floor covered with blood they drew
      back the bed-curtain, and found the unhappy Duke&rsquo;s body lying in the bed,
      sleeping the sleep from which one cannot awaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may imagine the mourning of these poor servants as they carried the
      body to the palace, whither came the Bishop, who told them how the
      gentleman had departed with all speed during the night under pretence of
      going to see his brother. And by this it was clearly shown that it was he
      who had committed the murder. And it was further proved that his poor
      sister had known nothing whatever of the matter. For her part, albeit she
      was astounded by what had happened, she could but love her brother the
      more, seeing that he had not shrunk from risking his life in order to save
      her from so cruel a tyrant. And so honourable and virtuous was the life
      that she continued leading, that although she was reduced to poverty by
      the confiscation of the family property, both she and her sister found as
      honourable and wealthy husbands as there were in all Italy, and lived ever
      afterwards in high and good repute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This, ladies, is a story that should make you dread that little god who
      delights in tormenting Prince and peasant, strong and weak, and so far
      blinds them that they lose all thought of God and conscience, and even of
      their own lives. And greatly should Princes and those in authority fear to
      offend such as are less than they; for there is no man but can wreak
      injury when it pleases God to take vengeance on a sinner, nor any man so
      great that he can do hurt to one who is in God&rsquo;s care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This tale was commended by all in the company, (6) but it gave rise to
      different opinions among them, for whilst some maintained that the
      gentleman had done his duty in saving his own life and his sister&rsquo;s
      honour, as well as in ridding his country of such a tyrant, others denied
      this, and said it was rank ingratitude to slay one who had bestowed on him
      such wealth and station. The ladies declared that the gentleman was a good
      brother and a worthy citizen; the men, on the contrary, that he was a
      treacherous and wicked servant.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     6  In MS. No. 1520 (Bib. Nat.) this sentence begins: &ldquo;The
     tale was attentively listened to by all,&rdquo; &amp;c.&mdash;L.
</pre>
    <p>
      And pleasant was it to hear the reasons which were brought forward on both
      sides; but the ladies, as is their wont, spoke as much from passion as
      from judgment, saying that the Duke was so well worthy of death that he
      who struck him down was a happy man indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Dagoucin, seeing what a controversy he had set on foot, said to them&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In God&rsquo;s name, ladies, do not quarrel about a thing that is past and
      gone. Take care rather that your own charms do not occasion more cruel
      murders than the one which I have related.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;La belle Dame sans Mercy,&rsquo;&rdquo; (7) replied Parlamente, &ldquo;has taught us to
      say that but few die of so pleasing an ailment.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     7  <i>La belle Dame sans Merci</i> (The Pitiless Beauty) is one
     of Alain Chartier&rsquo;s best known poems. It is written in the
     form of a dialogue between a lady and her lover: the former
     having obstinately refused to take compassion on the
     sufferings of her admirer, the latter is said to have died
     of despair. The lines alluded to by Margaret are spoken by
     the lady, and are to the following effect&mdash;&ldquo;So graceful a
     malady seldom puts men to death; yet the sooner to obtain
     comfort, it is fitting one should say that it did. Some
     complain and worry greatly who have not really felt the most
     bitter affliction; and if indeed Love doth cause such great
     torment, surely it were better there should be but one
     sufferer rather than two.&rdquo; The poem, as here quoted, will be
     found in André Duchesne&rsquo;s edition of the <i>OEuvres de Maistre
     Alain Chartier</i>, Paris, 1617, p. 502.&mdash;L.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would to God, madam,&rdquo; answered Dagoucin, &ldquo;that all the ladies in this
      company knew how false that saying is. I think they would then scarcely
      wish to be called pitiless, or to imitate that unbelieving beauty who
      suffered a worthy lover to die for lack of a gracious answer to his suit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;you would have us risk honour and conscience to
      save the life of a man who says he loves us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not my meaning,&rdquo; replied Dagoucin, &ldquo;for he who loves with a
      perfect love would be even more afraid of hurting his lady&rsquo;s honour than
      would she herself. I therefore think that an honourable and graceful
      response, such as is called for by perfect and seemly love, must tend to
      the increase of honour and the satisfaction of conscience, for no true
      lover could seek the contrary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is always the end of your speeches,&rdquo; said Ennasuite; &ldquo;they begin
      with honour and end with the contrary. However, if all the gentlemen
      present will tell the truth of the matter, I am ready to believe them on
      their oaths.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hircan swore that for his own part he had never loved any woman but his
      own wife, and even with her had no desire to be guilty of any gross
      offence against God.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simontault declared the same, and added that he had often wished all women
      were froward excepting his own wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; said Geburon to him, &ldquo;you deserve that your wife should be what
      you would have the others. For my own part, I can swear to you that I once
      loved a woman so dearly that I would rather have died than have led her to
      do anything that might have diminished my esteem for her. My love for her
      was so founded upon her virtues, that for no advantage that I might have
      had of her would I have seen them blemished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this Saffredent burst out laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Geburon,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I thought that your wife&rsquo;s affection and your own
      good sense would have guarded you from the danger of falling in love
      elsewhere, but I see that I was mistaken, for you still use the very
      phrases with which we are wont to beguile the most subtle of women, and to
      obtain a hearing from the most discreet. For who would close her ears
      against us when we begin our discourse by talking of honour and virtue?
      (8) But if we were to show them our hearts just as they are, there is many
      a man now welcome among the ladies whom they would reckon of but little
      account. But we hide the devil in our natures under the most angelic form
      we can devise, and in this disguise receive many favours before we are
      found out. And perhaps we lead the ladies&rsquo; hearts so far forward, that
      when they come upon vice while believing themselves on the high road to
      virtue, they have neither opportunity nor ability to draw back again.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <p>
      &ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; said Geburon, &ldquo;I thought you a different man than your words
      would show you to be, and fancied that virtue was more pleasing to you
      than pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said Saffredent. &ldquo;Is there any virtue greater than that of loving
      in the way that God commands? It seems to me that it is much better to
      love one woman as a woman than to adore a number of women as though they
      were so many idols. For my part, I am firmly of opinion that use is better
      than abuse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The ladies, however, all sided with Geburon, and would not allow
      Saffredent to continue, whereupon he said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am well content to say no more on this subject of love, for I have been
      so badly treated with regard to it that I will never return to it again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is your own maliciousness,&rdquo; said Longarine, &ldquo;that has occasioned your
      bad treatment; for what virtuous woman would have you for a lover after
      what you have told us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those who did not consider me unwelcome,&rdquo; answered Saffredent, &ldquo;would not
      care to exchange their virtue for yours. But let us say no more about it,
      that my anger may offend neither myself nor others. Let us see to whom
      Dagoucin will give his vote.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I give it to Parlamente,&rdquo; said Dagoucin, &ldquo;for I believe that she must
      know better than any one else the nature of honourable and perfect love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since I have been chosen to tell the third tale,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;I
      will tell you something that happened to a lady who has always been one of
      my best friends, and whose thoughts have never been hidden from me.&rdquo;

      <i>A sea-captain, being greatly in love with a lady, sent her a diamond;

      perfect affection</i>. (1)

     1   M. Le Roux de Lincy believes that this story has some
     historical basis, and, Louise of Savoy being termed the
     Regent, he assigns the earlier incidents to the year 1524.
     But Louise was Regent, for the first time, in 1515, and we
     incline to the belief that Queen Margaret alludes to this
     earlier period. Note the reference to a Court journey to
     Normandy (post, p. 136), which was probably the journey that
     Francis I. and his mother are known to have made to Rouen
     and Alençon in the autumn of 1517. See vol. i. p. xxviii.&mdash;
     Ed. 2  119
</pre>
    <p>
      In the household of the Lady-Regent, mother of King Francis, there was a
      very pious lady married to a gentleman of like mind with herself, and,
      albeit her husband was old and she was young and pretty, she served and
      loved him as though he had been the handsomest and youngest man in the
      world. So that she might give him no cause for sorrow, she set herself to
      live as though she were of the same age as himself, eschewing all such
      company, dress, dances, and amusements as young women are wont to love,
      and finding all her pleasure and recreation in the service of God; on
      which account her husband so loved and trusted her, that she ruled him and
      his household as she would.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day it happened that the gentleman told his wife that from his youth
      up he had desired to make a journey to Jerusalem, and asked her what she
      thought of it. She, whose only wish was to please him, replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since God has withheld children from us, sweetheart, and has granted us
      sufficient wealth, I would willingly use some portion of it in making this
      sacred journey with you, for indeed, whether you go thither or elsewhere,
      I am resolved never to leave you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this the good man was so pleased, that it seemed to him as though he
      were already on Mount Calvary.
    </p>
    <p>
      While they were deliberating on this matter, there came to the Court a
      gentleman, the Captain of a galley, who had often served in the wars
      against the Turks, (2) and was now soliciting the King of France to
      undertake an expedition against one of their cities, which might yield
      great advantage to Christendom. The old gentleman inquired of him
      concerning this expedition, and after hearing what he intended to do,
      asked him whether, on the completion of this business, he would make
      another journey to Jerusalem, whither he himself and his wife had a great
      desire to go. The Captain was well pleased on hearing of this laudable
      desire, and he promised to conduct them thither, and to keep the matter
      secret.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     2   M. Paul Lacroix, who believes that the heroine of this
     tale is Margaret herself (she is described as telling it
     under the name of Parlamente), is also of opinion that the
     gentleman referred to is the Baron de Malleville, a knight
     of Malta, who was killed at Beyrout during an expedition
     against the Turks, and whose death was recounted in verse by
     Clement Marot (<i>OEuvres</i>, 1731, vol. ii. p. 452-455).
     Margaret&rsquo;s gentleman, however, is represented as being
     married, whereas M. de Malleville, as a knight of Malta, was
     necessarily a bachelor. Marot, moreover, calls Malleville a
     Parisian, whereas the gentleman in the tale belonged to
     Normandy (see <i>post</i>, p. 136).&mdash;B. J. and L.
</pre>
    <p>
      The old gentleman was all impatience to find his wife and tell her of what
      he had done. She was as anxious to make the journey as her husband, and on
      that account often spoke about it to the Captain, who, paying more
      attention to her person than her words, fell so deeply in love with her,
      that when speaking to her of the voyages he had made, he often confused
      the port of Marseilles with the Archipelago, and said &ldquo;horse&rdquo; when he
      meant to say &ldquo;ship,&rdquo; like one distracted and bereft of sense. Her
      character, however, was such that he durst not give any token of the
      truth, and concealment kindled such fires in his heart that he often fell
      sick, when the lady showed as much solicitude for him as for the cross and
      guide of her road, (3) sending to inquire after him so often that the
      anxiety she showed cured him without the aid of any other medicine.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     3  This may simply be an allusion to wayside crosses which
     serve to guide travellers on their road. M. de Montaiglon
     points out, however, that in the alphabets used for teaching
     children in the olden time, the letter A was always preceded
     by a cross, and that the child, in reciting, invariably
     began: &ldquo;The cross of God, A, B, C, D,&rdquo; &amp;c. In a like way, a
     cross figured at the beginning of the guide-books of the
     time, as a symbol inviting the traveller to pray, and
     reminding him upon whom he should rely amid the perils of
     his journey. The best known French guide-book of the
     sixteenth century is Charles Estienne&rsquo;s <i>Guide des Chemins
     de France</i>.&mdash;M. and Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      Several persons who knew that this Captain had been more renowned for
      valour and jollity than for piety, were amazed that he should have become
      so intimate with this lady, and seeing that he had changed in every
      respect, and frequented churches, sermons, and confessions, they suspected
      that this was only in order to win the lady&rsquo;s favour, and could not
      refrain from hinting as much to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain feared that if the lady should hear any such talk he would be
      banished from her presence, and accordingly he told her husband and
      herself that he was on the point of being despatched on his journey by the
      King, and had much to tell them, but that for the sake of greater secrecy
      he did not desire to speak to them in the presence of others, for which
      reason he begged them to send for him when they had both retired for the
      night. The gentleman deemed this to be good advice, and did not fail to go
      to bed early every evening, and to make his wife also undress. When all
      their servants had left them, they used to send for the Captain, and talk
      with him about the journey to Jerusalem, in the midst of which the old
      gentleman would oft-times fall asleep with his mind full of pious
      thoughts. When the Captain saw the old gentleman asleep in bed, and found
      himself on a chair near her whom he deemed the fairest and noblest woman
      in the world, his heart was so rent between his desires and his dread of
      speaking that he often lost the power of speech. In order that she might
      not perceive this, he would force himself to talk of the holy places of
      Jerusalem where there were such signs of the great love that Jesus Christ
      bore us; and he would speak of this love, using it as a cloak for his own,
      and looking at the lady with sighs and tears which she never understood.
      By reason of his devout countenance she indeed believed him to be a very
      holy man, and begged of him to tell her what his life had been, and how he
      had come to love God in that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      He told her that he was a poor gentleman, who, to arrive at riches and
      honour, had disregarded his conscience in marrying a woman who was too
      close akin to him, and this on account of the wealth she possessed, albeit
      she was ugly and old, and he loved her not; and when he had drawn all her
      money from her, he had gone to seek his fortune at sea, and had so
      prospered by his toil, that he had now come to an honourable estate. But
      since he had made his hearer&rsquo;s acquaintance, she, by reason of her pious
      converse and good example, had changed all his manner of life, and should
      he return from his present enterprise he was wholly resolved to take her
      husband and herself to Jerusalem, that he might thereby partly atone for
      his grievous sins which he had now put from him; save that he had not yet
      made reparation to his wife, with whom, however, he hoped that he might
      soon be reconciled.
    </p>

      The lady was well pleased with this discourse, and especially rejoiced at
      having drawn such a man to the love and fear of God. And thus, until the
      Captain departed from the Court, their long conversations together were
      continued every evening without his ever venturing to declare himself.
      However, he made the lady a present of a crucifix of Our Lady of Pity, (4)
      beseeching her to think of him whenever she looked upon it.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     4   &ldquo;Our Lady of Pity&rdquo; is the designation usually applied to
     the Virgin when she is shown seated with the corpse of
     Christ on her knees. Michael Angelo&rsquo;s famous group at St.
     Peter&rsquo;s is commonly known by this name. In the present
     instance, however, Queen Margaret undoubtedly refers to a
     crucifix showing the Virgin at the foot of the Cross,
     contemplating her son&rsquo;s sufferings. Such crucifixes were
     formerly not uncommon.&mdash;M.

      The hour of his departure arrived, and when he had taken leave of the
      husband, who was falling asleep, and came to bid his lady farewell, he
      beheld tears standing in her eyes by reason of the honourable affection
      which she entertained for him. The sight of these rendered his passion for
      her so unendurable that, not daring to say anything concerning it, he
      almost fainted, and broke out into an exceeding sweat, so that he seemed
      to weep not only with his eyes, but with his entire body. And thus he
      departed without speaking, leaving the lady in great astonishment, for she
      had never before seen such tokens of regret. Nevertheless she did not
      change in her good opinion of him, and followed him with her prayers.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a month had gone by, however, as the lady was returning to her
      house, she met a gentleman who handed her a letter from the Captain, and
      begged her to read it in private.
    </p>
    <p>
      He told her how he had seen the Captain embark, fully resolved to
      accomplish whatever might be pleasing to the King and of advantage to
      Christianity. For his own part, the gentleman added, he was straightway
      going back to Marseilles to set the Captain&rsquo;s affairs in order.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady withdrew to a window by herself, and opening the letter, found it
      to consist of two sheets of paper, covered on either side with writing
      which formed the following epistle:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Concealment long and silence have, alas!
     Brought me all comfortless to such a pass,
     That now, perforce, I must, to ease my grief,
     Either speak out, or seek in death relief.
     Wherefore the tale I long have left untold
     I now, in lonely friendlessness grown bold,
     Send unto thee, for I must strive to say
     My love, or else prepare myself to slay.
     And though my eyes no longer may behold
     The sweet, who in her hand my life doth hold,
     Whose glance sufficed to make my heart rejoice,
     The while my ear did listen to her voice,&mdash;
     These words at least shall meet her beauteous eyes,
     And tell her all the plaintive, clamorous cries
     Pent in my heart, to which I must give breath,
     Since longer silence could but bring me death.
     And yet, at first, I was in truth full fain
     To blot the words I&rsquo;d written out again,
     Fearing, forsooth, I might offend thine ear
     With foolish phrases which, when thou wast near,
     I dared not utter; and &lsquo;Indeed,&rsquo; said I,
     &lsquo;Far better pine in silence, aye, and die,
     Than save myself by bringing her annoy
     For whose sweet sake grim death itself were joy.&rsquo;
     And yet, thought I, my death some pain might give
     To her for whom I would be strong, and live:
     For have I not, fair lady, promised plain,
     My journey ended, to return again
     And guide thee and thy spouse to where he now
     Doth yearn to call on God from Sion&rsquo;s brow?
     And none would lead thee thither should I die.
     If I were dead, methinks I see thee sigh
     In sore distress, for then thou couldst not start
     Upon that journey, dear unto thy heart.
     So I will live, and, in a little space,
     Return to lead thee to the sacred place.
     Aye, I will live, though death a boon would be
     Only to be refused for sake of thee.
     But if I live, I needs must straight remove
     The burden from my heart, and speak my love,
     That love more loyal, tender, deep, and true,
     Than, ever yet, the fondest lover knew.
     And now, bold words about to wing your flight,
     What will ye say when ye have reached her sight?
     Declare her all the love that fills my heart?
     Too weak ye are to tell its thousandth part!
     Can ye at least not say that her clear eyes
     Have torn my hapless heart forth in such wise,
     That like a hollow tree I pine and wither
     Unless hers give me back some life and vigour?
     Ye feeble words! ye cannot even tell
     How easily her eyes a heart compel;
     Nor can ye praise her speech in language fit,
     So weak and dull ye are, so void of wit.
     Yet there are some things I would have you name&mdash;
     How mute and foolish I oft time became
     When all her grace and virtue I beheld;
     How from my &lsquo;raptured eyes tears slowly welled
     The tears of hopeless love; how my tongue strayed
     From fond and wooing speech, so sore afraid,
     That all my discourse was of time and tide,
     And of the stars which up in Heav&rsquo;n abide.
     O words, alas! ye lack the skill to tell
     The dire confusion that upon me fell,
     Whilst love thus wracked me; nor can ye disclose
     My love&rsquo;s immensity, its pains and woes.
     Yet, though, for all, your powers be too weak,
     Perchance, some little, ye are fit to speak&mdash;
     Say to her thus: &ldquo;Twas fear lest thou shouldst chide
     That drove me, e&rsquo;en so long, my love to hide,
     And yet, forsooth, it might have openly
     Been told to God in Heaven, as unto thee,
     Based as it is upon thy virtue&mdash;thought
     That to my torments frequent balm hath brought,
     For who, indeed, could ever deem it sin
     To seek the owner of all worth to win?
     Deserving rather of our blame were he
     Who having seen thee undisturbed could be.&rsquo;
     None such was I, for, straightway stricken sore,
     My heart bowed low to Love, the conqueror.
     And ah! no false and fleeting love is mine,
     Such as for painted beauty feigns to pine;
     Nor doth my passion, although deep and strong,
     Seek its own wicked pleasure in thy wrong.
     Nay; on this journey I would rather die
     Than know that thou hadst fallen, and that I
     Had wrought thy shame and foully brought to harm
     The virtue which thy heart wraps round thy form.
     &lsquo;Tis thy perfection that I love in thee,
     Nought that might lessen it could ever be
     Desire of mine&mdash;indeed, the nobler thou,
     The greater were the love I to thee vow.
     I do not seek an ardent flame to quench
     In lustful dalliance with some merry wench,
     Pure is my heart, &lsquo;neath reason&rsquo;s calm control
     Set on a lady of such lofty soul,
     That neither God above nor angel bright,
     But seeing her, would echo my delight.
     And if of thee I may not be beloved,
     What matter, shouldst thou deem that I have proved
     The truest lover that did ever live?
     And this I know thou wilt, one day, believe,
     For time, in rolling by, shall show to thee
     No change in my heart&rsquo;s faith and loyalty.
     And though for this thou mayst make no return,
     Yet pleased am I with love for thee to burn,
     And seek no recompense, pursue no end,
     Save, that to thee, I meekly recommend
     My soul and body, which I here consign
     In sacrifice to Love&rsquo;s consuming shrine.
     If then in safety I sail back the main
     To thee, still artless, I&rsquo;ll return again;
     And if I die, then there will die with me
     A lover such as none again shall see.
     So Ocean now doth carry far away
     The truest lover seen for many a day;
     His body &lsquo;tis that journeys o&rsquo;er the wave,
     But not his heart, for that is now thy slave,
     And from thy side can never wrested be,
     Nor of its own accord return to me.
     Ah! could I with me o&rsquo;er the treach&rsquo;rous brine
     Take aught of that pure, guileless heart of thine,
     No doubt should I then feel of victory,
     Whereof the glory would belong to thee.
     But now, whatever fortune may befall,
     I&rsquo;ve cast the die; and having told thee all,
     Abide thereby, and vow my constancy&mdash;
     Emblem of which, herein, a diamond see,
     By whose great firmness and whose pure glow
     The strength and pureness of my love thou&rsquo;lt know.
     Let it, I pray, thy fair white finger press,
     And thou wilt deal me more than happiness.
     And, diamond, speak and say: &lsquo;To thee I come
     From thy fond lover, who afar doth roam,
     And strives by dint of glorious deeds to rise
     To the high level of the good and wise,
     Hoping some day that haven to attain,
     Where thy sweet favours shall reward his pain.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The lady read the letter through, and was the more astonished at the
      Captain&rsquo;s passion as she had never before suspected it. She looked at the
      cutting of the diamond, which was a large and beautiful one, set in a ring
      of black enamel, and she was in great doubt as to what she ought to do
      with it. After pondering upon the matter throughout the night, she was
      glad to find that since there was no messenger, she had no occasion to
      send any answer to the Captain, who, she reflected, was being sufficiently
      tried by those matters of the King, his master, which he had in hand,
      without being angered by the unfavourable reply which she was resolved to
      make to him, though she delayed it until his return. However, she found
      herself greatly perplexed with regard to the diamond, for she had never
      been wont to adorn herself at the expense of any but her husband. For this
      reason, being a woman of excellent understanding, she determined to draw
      from the ring some profit to the Captain&rsquo;s conscience. She therefore
      despatched one of her servants to the Captain&rsquo;s wife with the following
      letter, which was written as though it came from a nun of Tarascon:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MADAM,&mdash;Your husband passed this way but a short time before he
      embarked, and after he had confessed himself and received his Creator like
      a good Christian, he spoke to me of something which he had upon his
      conscience, namely, his sorrow at not having loved you as he should have
      done. And on departing, he prayed and besought me to send you this letter,
      with the diamond which goes with it, and which he begs of you to keep for
      his sake, assuring you that if God bring him back again in health and
      strength, you shall be better treated than ever woman was before. And this
      stone of steadfastness shall be the pledge thereof.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg you to remember him in your prayers; in mine he will have a place
      as long as I live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This letter, being finished and signed with the name of a nun, was sent by
      the lady to the Captain&rsquo;s wife. And as may be readily believed, when the
      excellent old woman saw the letter and the ring, she wept for joy and
      sorrow at being loved and esteemed by her good husband when she could no
      longer see him. She kissed the ring a thousand times and more, watering it
      with her tears, and blessing God for having restored her husband&rsquo;s
      affection to her at the end of her days, when she had long looked upon it
      as lost. Nor did she fail to thank the nun who had given her so much
      happiness, but sent her the fairest reply that she could devise. This the
      messenger brought back with all speed to his mistress, who could not read
      it, nor listen to what her servant told her, without much laughter. And so
      pleased was she at having got rid of the diamond in so profitable a
      fashion as to bring about a reconciliation between the husband and wife,
      that she was as happy as though she had gained a kingdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      A short time afterwards tidings came of the defeat and death of the poor
      Captain, and of how he had been abandoned by those who ought to have
      succoured him, and how his enterprise had been revealed by the Rhodians
      who should have kept it secret, so that he and all who landed with him, to
      the number of eighty, had been slain, among them being a gentleman named
      John, and a Turk to whom the lady of my story had stood godmother, both of
      them having been given by her to the Captain that he might take them with
      him on his journey. The first named of these had died beside the Captain,
      whilst the Turk, wounded by arrows in fifteen places, had saved himself by
      swimming to the French ships.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was through him alone that the truth of the whole affair became known.
      A certain gentleman whom the poor Captain had taken to be his friend and
      comrade, and whose interests he had advanced with the King and the highest
      nobles of France, had, it appeared, stood out to sea with his ships as
      soon as the Captain landed; and the Captain, finding that his expedition
      had been betrayed, and that four thousand Turks were at hand, had
      thereupon endeavoured to retreat, as was his duty. But the gentleman in
      whom he put such great trust perceived that his friend&rsquo;s death would leave
      the sole command and profit of that great armament to himself, and
      accordingly pointed out to the officers that it would not be right to risk
      the King&rsquo;s vessels or the lives of the many brave men on board them in
      order to save less than a hundred persons, an opinion which was shared by
      all those of the officers that possessed but little courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the Captain, finding that the more he called to the ships the farther
      they drew away from his assistance, faced round at last upon the Turks;
      and, albeit he was up to his knees in sand, he did such deeds of arms and
      valour that it seemed as though he alone would defeat all his enemies, an
      issue which his traitorous comrade feared far more than he desired it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at last, in spite of all that he could do, the Captain received so
      many wounds from the arrows of those who durst not approach within
      bowshot, that he began to lose all his blood, whereupon the Turks,
      perceiving the weakness of these true Christians, charged upon them
      furiously with their scimitars; but the Christians, so long as God gave
      them strength and life, defended themselves to the bitter end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the Captain called to the gentleman named John, whom his lady love
      had given him, and to the Turk as well, and thrusting the point of his
      sword into the ground, fell upon his knees beside it, and embraced and
      kissed the cross, (5) saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord, receive into Thy hands the soul of one who has not spared his life
      to exalt Thy name.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     5  As is well known, before swords were made with shell and
     stool hilts, the two guards combined with the handle and
     blade formed a cross. Bayard, when dying, raised his sword
     to gaze upon this cross, and numerous instances, similar to
     that mentioned above by Queen Margaret, may be found in the
     old <i>Chansons de Geste</i>.&mdash;M.
</pre>
    <p>
      The gentleman called John, seeing that his master&rsquo;s life was ebbing away
      as he uttered these words, thought to aid him, and took him into his arms,
      together with the sword which he was holding. But a Turk who was behind
      them cut through both his thighs, whereupon he cried out, &ldquo;Come, Captain,
      let us away to Paradise to see Him for whose sake we die,&rdquo; and in this
      wise he shared the poor Captain&rsquo;s death even as he had shared his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Turk, seeing that he could be of no service to either of them, and
      being himself wounded by arrows in fifteen places, made off towards the
      ships, and requested to be taken on board. But although of all the eighty
      he was the only one who had escaped, the Captain&rsquo;s traitorous comrade
      refused his prayer. Nevertheless, being an exceeding good swimmer, he
      threw himself into the sea, and exerted himself so well that he was at
      last received on board a small vessel, where in a short time he was cured
      of his wounds. And it was by means of this poor foreigner that the truth
      became fully known, to the honour of the Captain and the shame of his
      comrade, whom the King and all the honourable people who heard the tidings
      deemed guilty of such wickedness toward God and man that there was no
      death howsoever cruel which he did not deserve. But when he returned he
      told so many lies, and gave so many gifts, that not only did he escape
      punishment, but even received the office of the man whose unworthy servant
      he had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the pitiful tidings reached the Court, the Lady-Regent, who held the
      Captain in high esteem, mourned for him exceedingly, as did the King and
      all the honourable people who had known him. And when the lady whom he had
      loved the best heard of his strange, sad, and Christian death, she changed
      the chiding she had resolved to give him into tears and lamentations, in
      which her husband kept her company, all hopes of their journey to
      Jerusalem being now frustrated.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must not forget to say that on the very day when the two gentlemen were
      killed, a damsel in the lady&rsquo;s service, who loved the gentleman called
      John better than herself, came and told her mistress that she had seen her
      lover ir a dream; he had appeared to her clad in white, and had bidden her
      farewell, telling her that he was going to Paradise with his Captain. And
      when the damsel heard that her dream had come true, she made such
      lamentation that her mistress had enough to do to comfort her. (6)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     6  The Queen of Navarre was a firm believer in the truth and
     premonitory character of dreams, and according to her
     biographers she, herself, had several singular ones, two of
     which are referred to in the Memoir prefixed to the present
     work (vol. i. pp. lxxxiii. and Ixxxvii.). In some of her
     letters, moreover, she relates that Francis I., when under
     the walls of Pavia, on three successive nights beheld his
     little daughter Charlotte (then dying at Lyons) appear to
     him in a dream, and on each occasion repeat the words,
     &ldquo;Farewell, my King, I am going to Paradise.&rdquo;&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      A short time afterwards the Court journeyed into Normandy, to which
      province the Captain had belonged. His wife was not remiss in coming to
      pay homage to the Lady-Regent, and in order that she might be presented to
      her, she had recourse to the same lady whom her husband had so dearly
      loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      And while they were waiting in a church for the appointed hour, she began
      bewailing and praising her husband, saying among other things to the lady&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, madam! my misfortune is the greatest that ever befell a woman, for
      just when he was loving me more than he had ever done, God took him from
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, and with many tears, she showed the ring which she wore on her
      finger as a token of her husband&rsquo;s perfect love, whereat the other lady,
      finding that her deception had resulted in such a happy issue, was,
      despite her sorrow for the Captain&rsquo;s death, so moved to laughter, that she
      would not present the widow to the Regent, but committed her to the charge
      of another lady, and withdrew into a side chapel, where she satisfied her
      inclination to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, ladies, that those who receive such gifts ought to seek to use
      them to as good a purpose as did this worthy lady. They would find that
      benefactions bring joy to those who bestow them. And we must not charge
      this lady with deceit, but esteem her good sense which turned to good that
      which in itself was worthless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say,&rdquo; said Nomerfide, &ldquo;that a fine diamond, costing two
      hundred crowns, is worthless? I can assure you that if it had fallen into
      my hands, neither his wife nor his relations would have seen aught of it.
      Nothing is more wholly one&rsquo;s own than a gift. The gentleman was dead, no
      one knew anything about the matter, and she might well have spared the
      poor old woman so much sorrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By my word,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;you are right. There are women who, to make
      themselves appear of better heart than others, do things that are clearly
      contrary to their notions, for we all know that women are the most
      avaricious of beings, yet their vanity often surpasses their avarice, and
      constrains their hearts to actions that they would rather not perform. My
      belief is that the lady who gave the diamond away in this fashion was
      unworthy to wear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Softly, softly,&rdquo; said Oisille; &ldquo;I believe I know who she is, and I
      therefore beg that you will not condemn her unheard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;I do not condemn her at all; but if the gentleman
      was as virtuous as you say, it were an honour to have such a lover, and to
      wear his ring; but perhaps some one less worthy of being loved than he
      held her so fast by the finger that the ring could not be put on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; said Ennasuite, &ldquo;she might well have kept it, seeing that no one
      knew anything about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said Geburon; &ldquo;are all things lawful to those who love, provided
      no one knows anything about them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By my word,&rdquo; said Saffredent, &ldquo;the only misdeed that I have ever seen
      punished is foolishness. There is never a murderer, robber, or adulterer
      condemned by the courts or blamed by his fellows, if only he be as cunning
      as he is wicked. Oft-time, however, a bad man&rsquo;s wickedness so blinds him
      that he becomes a fool; and thus, as I have just said, it is the foolish
      only that are punished, not the vicious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may say what you please,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;only God can judge the
      lady&rsquo;s heart; but for my part, I think that her action was a very
      honourable and virtuous one. (7) However, to put an end to the debate, I
      pray you, Parlamente, to give some one your vote.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     7  In our opinion this sentence disposes of Miss Mary
     Robinson&rsquo;s supposition (<i>The Fortunate Lovers</i>, London,
     1887, p. 159) that Oisille (i.e., Louise of Savoy) is the
     real heroine of this tale. Queen Margaret would hardly have
     represented her commending her own action. If any one of the
     narrators of the <i>Heptameron</i> be the heroine of the story,
     the presumptions are in favour of Longarine (La Dame de
     Lonray), Margaret&rsquo;s bosom friend, whose silence during the
     after-converse is significant.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I give it willingly,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to Simontault, for after two such
      mournful tales we must have one that will not make us weep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you,&rdquo; said Simontault. &ldquo;In giving me your vote you have all but
      told me that I am a jester. It is a name that is extremely distasteful to
      me, and in revenge I will show you that there are women who with certain
      persons, or for a certain time, make a great pretence of being chaste, but
      the end shows them in their real colours, as you will see by this true
      story.&rdquo;

      <i>TALE XIV</i>.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>The Lord of Bonnivet, desiring to revenge himself upon a
     Milanese lady for her cruelty, made the acquaintance of an
     Italian gentleman whom she loved, but to whom she had never
     granted anything save fair words and assurances of
     affection. To accomplish his purpose he gave this gentleman
     such good advice that the lady granted him what he had so
     long sought, and this the gentleman made known to Bonnivet,
     who, having cut both hair and beard, and dressed himself in
     clothes like those of the other, went at midnight and put
     his vengeance into execution. Then the lady, having learnt
     from him the plan that he had devised to win her, promised
     to desist from loving those of her own nation, and to hold
     fast to him</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      At the time when the Grand-Master of Chaumont was Governor of the Duchy of
      Milan, (1) there lived there a gentleman called the Lord of Bonnivet, who
      by reason of his merits was afterwards made Admiral of France. Being
      greatly liked by the Grand-Master and every one else on account of the
      qualities he possessed, he was a welcome guest at the banquets where the
      ladies of Milan assembled, and was regarded by them with more favour than
      ever fell to a Frenchman&rsquo;s lot, either before or since; and this as much
      on account of his handsome countenance, grace of manner, and pleasant
      converse, as by reason of the renown which he had gained among all as
      being one of the most skilful and valorous soldiers of his time. (2)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1   M. de Lincy is of opinion that the incidents recorded in
     this story took place between 1501 and 1503; but according
     to M. Lacroix, the Grand-Master of Chaumont did not become
     Governor of the Milanese till 1506. This personage, to whom
     Queen Margaret frequently alludes in her tales, was Charles
     d&rsquo;Amboise, nephew of the famous Cardinal d&rsquo;Amboise, minister
     to Louis XII. In turn admiral and marshal, Governor of
     Paris, and Grand-Master, in France, of the Order of St. John
     of Jerusalem, he figured prominently in the Italian wars of
     the time, and notably at the battle of Aignadel. In 1510 he
     commanded the troops which fought on behalf of the Duke of
     Ferrara against the Emperor and Pope Julius II., and the
     latter having excommunicated him for bearing arms against
     the Holy See, his mind is said to have become unhinged. He
     died at Correggio in February 1511, when only thirty-eight
     years of age, some biographers asserting that he was
     poisoned, whilst others contend that he fell from a bridge
     during a military expedition. Whilst on his death-bed, he
     sent messengers to the Pope, begging that the decree of
     excommunication against him might be annulled, but before
     the Papal absolution arrived he had expired. The name of
     Chaumont, by which he is generally known, is that of an
     estate he possessed, between Blois and Amboise, on the
     Loire. The reputation he enjoyed of being one of the
     handsomest men of his time was well deserved, if one may
     judge by a painting at the Louvre which is said to be his
     portrait. This picture, long ascribed to Leonardo da Vinci,
     and supposed to represent Charles VIII. of France, has been
     identified as the work of Andreas Solario, who executed
     numerous paintings for Cardinal d&rsquo;Amboise at the famous
     château of Gaillon.&mdash;L. M. and Eu.

     2  Some particulars concerning William Gouffier, Lord of
     Bonnivet, have been given in vol. i. (Tale IV. n. 3). It
     may here be mentioned that the domain whence he derived the
     name by which he is generally known was in the neighbourhood
     of Poitiers, around the village of Vendeuvre, where he built
     himself a vast château, destroyed at the close of the
     eighteenth century. Some fragments of the sculptured work
     adorning it, remarkable for their elegance of design and
     delicacy of workmanship, are in the Poitiers Museum. It is
     not unlikely that the incidents related in Tale IV. occurred
     at this château; or else at that of Oiron, another domain of
     the Gouffiers, between Loudun and Bressuire. In the chapel
     of Oiron were buried Bonnivet, his mother, his brother
     Artus, and his nephew Claud. Their tombs, large marble
     mausoleums of Italian workmanship, surmounted by recumbent
     statues, were opened and mutilated by the Huguenots in 1568,
     when the bones they contained were scattered to the winds.
     Bon-nivet&rsquo;s statue is probably the most damaged of the four.
     The château of Oiron, with its marble staircases, quaint
     frescoes, sculptured medallions, &amp;c, testifies to the great
     wealth possessed by the Gouffier family, and justifies the
     cynical motto assumed by Bonnivet&rsquo;s nephew: &ldquo;Others have
     beaten the bushes, but we have the birds.&rdquo;&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      One day during the carnival, when he was among the maskers, he danced with
      one of the most beautiful and bravely attired ladies to be found in the
      whole city; and whenever a pause occurred in the music of the hautboys, he
      did not fail to address her with love speeches, in which he excelled all
      others. But she (3) having no favourable reply to give him, suddenly
      checked his discourse by assuring him that she neither loved nor ever
      would love any man but her husband, and that he must by no means expect
      that she would listen to him.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     3  This lady may perhaps be the &ldquo;Sennora Clerice&rdquo; (Clarissa)
     of whom Brantôme writes as follows in his <i>Capitaines
     François</i>:&mdash;&ldquo;It was Bonnivet alone who advised King Francis
     to cross the mountains and follow M. de Bourbon, and in this
     he had less his master&rsquo;s advantage and service at heart than
     his desire to return and see a great and most beautiful lady
     of Milan, whom he had made his mistress some years
     previously.... It is said that this was the &lsquo;Sennora
     Clerice,&rsquo; then accounted one of the most beautiful ladies of
     Italy.... A great lady of the time, from whom I heard this
     story, told me that he, Bonnivet, had commended this lady
     Clerice to the King so highly as to make him desirous of
     seeing and winning her; and this was the principal cause of
     this expedition of the King&rsquo;s.&rdquo;&mdash;Lalanne&rsquo;s <i>OEuvres de
     Brantôme</i>, vol. ii. p. 167-8.&mdash;L.
</pre>
    <p>
      The gentleman, however, would not take this answer for a refusal, and
      continued to press his suit with great energy until mid-Lent. But he found
      her still firm in her declaration that she would love neither himself nor
      another, which he could not believe, however, seeing how ill-favoured was
      her husband, and how great her own beauty. Convinced that she was
      practising dissimulation, he resolved, on his own side, to have recourse
      to deception, and accordingly he ceased to urge his suit, and inquired so
      closely concerning her manner of life that he discovered she was in love
      with a most discreet and honourable Italian gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little by little the Lord of Bonnivet insinuated himself into the
      friendship of this gentleman, and did so with so much discretion and
      skill, that the other remained ignorant of his motive, and became so much
      attached to him that, after the lady of his heart, there was no one in the
      world whom he loved more. In order that he might pluck his secret from his
      breast, the Lord of Bonnivet pretended to tell him his own, declaring that
      he loved a certain lady to whom he had in truth never given a thought, and
      begging that he would keep the matter secret, and that they might have but
      one heart and one mind together. Wishing to show in return a like
      affection, the poor Italian gentleman thereupon proceeded to disclose at
      length the love that he bore the lady on whom Bonnivet wished to be
      revenged; and after this they would meet somewhere once every day in order
      to recount the favours that had befallen them during the past four and
      twenty hours; with this difference, however, that one lied, and the other
      spoke the truth. And the Italian confessed that he had loved this lady for
      three years, but had never obtained anything of her save fair words and
      the assurance of her love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bonnivet then gave him all the advice that he could to enable him to
      attain his end, and to such good purpose that in a few days the lady
      consented to grant all that was sought of her. It only remained to devise
      a plan for their meeting, and through the counsels of Bonnivet this was
      soon accomplished. And so one day before supper the Italian said to him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am more beholden to you, sir, than to any other man living, for, thanks
      to your good advice, I expect to obtain to-night that which I have coveted
      so many years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pray you, my friend,&rdquo; thereupon said Bonnivet, &ldquo;tell me the manner of
      your undertaking, so that if there be any risk in it, or craft required, I
      may serve you in all friendship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Italian gentleman then began to tell him that the lady had devised a
      means of having the principal door of the house left open that night,
      availing herself as a pretext of the illness of one of her brothers for
      whose requirements it was necessary to send into the town at all hours. He
      might enter the courtyard, but he was to be careful not to go up by the
      principal staircase. Instead of this he was to take a small flight on his
      right hand, and enter the first gallery he came to, into which the rooms
      of the lady&rsquo;s father-in-law and brothers-in-law opened; and he was to
      choose the third door from the head of the stairs, and if on trying it
      gently he found that it was locked, he was to go away again, for in that
      case he might be sure that her husband had returned, though not expected
      back for two days. If, however, he found that the door was open, he was to
      enter softly, and boldly bolt it behind him, for in that case there would
      be none but herself in the room. And above all, he was to get himself felt
      shoes, in order that he might make no noise, and he was to be careful not
      to come earlier than two hours after midnight, for her brothers-in-law,
      who were fond of play, never went to bed until after one of the clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go, my friend,&rdquo; replied Bonnivet, &ldquo;and may God be with you and preserve
      you from mischief. If my company can be of any service to you, I am wholly
      at your disposal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Italian gentleman thanked him warmly, but said that in an affair of
      this nature he could not be too much alone; and thereupon he went away to
      set about his preparations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bonnivet, on his part, did not go to sleep, for he saw that the time had
      come for revenging himself upon his cruel love. Going home betimes, he had
      his beard trimmed to the same length and breadth as the Italian&rsquo;s, and
      also had his hair cut, so that, on touching him, no difference between
      himself and his rival might be perceived. Nor did he forget the felt
      shoes, nor garments such as the Italian was wont to wear. Being greatly
      liked by the lady&rsquo;s father-in-law, he was not afraid to go to the house at
      an early hour, for he made up his mind that if he were perceived, he would
      go straight to the chamber of the old gentleman, with whom he had some
      business on hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      About midnight he entered the lady&rsquo;s house, and although there were a good
      many persons going to and fro, he passed them unnoticed and thus reached
      the gallery. Trying the first two doors, he found them shut; the third,
      however, was not, and he softly pushed it open. And having thus entered
      the lady&rsquo;s room, he immediately bolted the door behind him. He found that
      the whole chamber was hung with white linen, the floor and ceiling also
      being covered with the same; and there was a bed draped with cloth so fine
      and soft and so handsomely embroidered in white, that nothing better were
      possible. And in the bed lay the lady alone, wearing her cap and
      night-gown, and covered with pearls and gems. This, before he was himself
      perceived by her, he was able to see by peeping round the curtain; for
      there was a large wax candle burning, which made the room as bright as
      day. And fearful lest he should be recognised by her, he first of all put
      out the light. Then he undressed himself and got into bed beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady, taking him to be the Italian who had so long loved her, gave him
      the best possible reception; but he, not forgetting that he was there in
      another&rsquo;s stead, was careful not to say a single word. His only thought
      was to execute his vengeance at the cost of her honour and chastity
      without being beholden to her for any boon. And although this was contrary
      to her intention, the lady was so well pleased with this vengeance that
      she deemed him rewarded for all she thought he had endured. At last it
      struck one of the clock, and it was time to say good-bye. Then, in the
      lowest tones he could employ, he asked her if she were as well pleased
      with him as he was with her. She, believing him to be her lover, said that
      she was not merely pleased but amazed at the greatness of his love, which
      had kept him an hour without answering her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he began to laugh aloud, and said to her&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, madam, will you refuse me another time, as you have hitherto been
      wont to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lady, recognising him by his speech and laughter, was in such despair
      with grief and shame, that she called him villain, traitor, and deceiver a
      thousand times over, and tried to throw herself out of bed to search for a
      knife in order to kill herself, since she was so unfortunate as to have
      lost her honour through a man whom she did not love, and who to be
      revenged on her might publish the matter to the whole world.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he held her fast in his arms, and in fair soft words declared that he
      would <i>love</i> her more than her lover, and would so carefully conceal
      all that affected her honour that she should never be brought to reproach.
      This the poor foolish thing believed, and on hearing from him the plan
      that he had devised and the pains that he had taken to win her, she swore
      to him that she would love him better than the other, who had not been
      able to keep her secret. She now knew, said she, how false was the repute
      in which the French were held; they were more sensible, persevering, and
      discreet than the Italians; wherefore she would henceforward lay aside the
      erroneous opinions of her nation and hold fast to him. But she earnestly
      entreated him not to show himself for some time at any entertainment or in
      any place where she might be unless he were masked; for she was sure she
      should feel so much ashamed that her countenance would betray her to every
      one.
    </p>
    <p>
      This he promised to do, and he then begged that she would give her lover a
      good welcome when he came at two o&rsquo;clock, getting rid of him afterwards by
      degrees. This she was very loth to do, and but for the love she bore to
      Bonnivet would on no account have consented. However, when bidding her
      farewell, he gave her so much cause for satisfaction that she would fain
      have had him stay with her some time longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having risen and donned his garments again, he departed, leaving the door
      of the room slightly open, as he had found it. And as it was now nearly
      two o&rsquo;clock, and he was afraid of meeting the Italian gentleman, he
      withdrew to the top of the staircase, whence he not long afterwards saw
      the other pass by and enter the lady&rsquo;s room.
    </p>
    <p>
      For his own part, he then betook himself home to rest, in such wise that
      at nine of the clock on the following morning he was still in bed. While
      he was rising, there arrived the Italian gentleman, who did not fail to
      recount his fortune, which had not been so great as he had hoped; for on
      entering the lady&rsquo;s chamber, said he, he had found her out of bed, wearing
      her dressing-gown, and in a high fever, with her pulse beating quick and
      her countenance aflame, and a perspiration beginning to break out upon
      her. She had therefore begged him to go away forthwith, for fearing a
      mishap, she had not ventured to summon her women, and was in consequence
      so ill that she had more need to think of death than of love, and to be
      told of God than of Cupid. She was distressed, she added, that he should
      have run such risk for her sake, since she was wholly unable to grant what
      he sought in a world she was so soon to leave. He had felt so astonished
      and unhappy on hearing this that all his fire and joy had been changed to
      ice and sadness, and he had immediately gone away. However, he had sent at
      daybreak to inquire about her, and had heard that she was indeed very ill.
      While recounting his griefs he wept so piteously that it seemed as though
      his soul must melt away in his tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bonnivet, who was as much inclined to laugh as the other was to weep,
      comforted him as well as he could, telling him that affections of long
      duration always had a difficult beginning, and that Love was causing him
      this delay only that he might afterwards have the greater joy. And so the
      two gentlemen parted. The lady remained in bed for some days, and on
      regaining her health dismissed her first suitor, alleging as her reason
      the fear of death that had beset her and the prickings of her conscience.
      But she held fast to my lord Bonnivet, whose love, as is usual, lasted no
      longer than the field flowers bloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, ladies, that the gentleman&rsquo;s craftiness was a match for the
      hypocrisy of the lady, who, after playing the prude so long, showed
      herself such a wanton in the end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may say what you please about women,&rdquo; said Ennasuite, &ldquo;but the
      gentleman played an evil trick. Is it allowable that if a lady loves one
      man, another may obtain her by craft?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may be sure,&rdquo; said Geburon, &ldquo;that when such mares are for sale they
      are of necessity carried off by the last and highest bidder. Do not
      imagine that wooers take such great pains for the ladies&rsquo; sakes. It is for
      their own sakes and their own pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By my word,&rdquo; said Longarine, &ldquo;I believe you; for, truth to tell, all the
      lovers that I have ever had have always begun their speeches by talking
      about me, declaring that they cherished my life, welfare, and honour; but
      in the end they only thought of themselves, caring for nought but their
      own pleasure and vanity. The best plan, therefore, is to dismiss them as
      soon as the first portion of their discourse is ended; for when they come
      to the second, there is not so much credit in refusing them, seeing that
      vice when recognised must needs be rejected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So as soon as a man opens his mouth,&rdquo; said Ennasuite, &ldquo;we ought to refuse
      him, without knowing what he is going to say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; replied Parlamente, &ldquo;my friend does not mean that. We know that at
      first a woman should never appear to understand what the man desires, or
      even to believe him when he has declared what it is; but when he comes to
      strong protestations, I think it were better for ladies to leave him on
      the road rather than continue to the end of the journey with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may be,&rdquo; said Nomerfide; &ldquo;but are we to believe that they love us
      for evil? Is it not a sin to judge our neighbours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may believe what you please,&rdquo; said Oisille; &ldquo;but there is so much
      cause for fearing it to be true, that as soon as you perceive the faintest
      spark, you should flee from this fire, lest it should burn up your heart
      before you even know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;the laws you lay down are over harsh. If women,
      whom gentleness beseems so well, were minded to prove as rigorous as you
      would have them be, we men, on our part, would exchange our gentle
      entreaties for craft and force.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my opinion,&rdquo; said Simontault, &ldquo;the best advice is that each should
      follow his natural bent. Whether he love or not, let him do so without
      dissimulation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would to God,&rdquo; said Saffredent, &ldquo;that such a rule would bring as much
      honour as it would give pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dagoucin, however, could not refrain from saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those who would rather die than make their desire known could not comply
      with your law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Die!&rdquo; thereupon said Hircan; &ldquo;the good knight has yet to be born that
      would die for the publishing of such a matter. But let us cease talking of
      what is impossible, and see to whom Simontault will give his vote.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I give it,&rdquo; said Simontault, &ldquo;to Longarine, for I observed her just now
      talking to herself. I imagine that she was recalling some excellent
      matter, and she is not wont to conceal the truth, whether it be against
      man or woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since you deem me so truthful,&rdquo; replied Longarine, &ldquo;I will tell you a
      tale which, though it be not so much to the praise of women as I could
      wish it to be, will yet show you that there are some possessed of as much
      spirit, wit, and craft as men. If my tale be somewhat long, you will bear
      with it in patience.&rdquo;

      <i>TALE XV</i>.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>Through the favour of King Francis, a simple gentleman of
     the Court married a very rich woman, of whom, however, as
     much by reason of her extreme youth as of the bestowal of
     his own heart elsewhere, he made but little account;
     whereat, after trying every plan to please him, she was so
     moved with resentment and overcome by despair, that she
     resolved to console herself with another for the indignities
     which she endured from her husband.</i> (1)

     1  The incidents referred to in this story must have
     occurred between 1515 and 1543, during the reign of Francis
     I.&mdash;L.
</pre>
    <p>
      At the Court of King Francis the First there was a gentleman whose name I
      know right well, but will not mention. He was poor, having less than five
      hundred livres a year, but he was so well liked by the King for his many
      qualities that he at last married a lady of such wealth that a great lord
      would have been pleased to take her. As she was still very young, he
      begged one of the greatest ladies of the Court to receive her into her
      household, and this the lady very willingly did.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now this gentleman was so courteous, so handsome, and so full of grace
      that he was held in great regard by all the ladies of the Court, and among
      the rest by one whom the King loved, and who was neither so young nor so
      handsome as his own wife. And by reason of the great love that the
      gentleman bore this lady, he made such little account of his wife, that he
      slept scarcely one night in the year with her, and, what she found still
      harder to endure, he never spoke to her or showed her any sign of love.
      And although he enjoyed her fortune, he allowed her so small a share in
      it, that she was not dressed as was fitting for one of her station, or as
      she herself desired. The lady with whom she abode would often reproach the
      gentleman for this, saying to him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your wife is handsome, rich, and of a good family, yet you make no more
      account of her than if she were the opposite. In her extreme youth and
      childishness she has hitherto submitted to your neglect; but I fear me
      that when she finds herself grown-up and handsome, her mirror and some one
      that loves you not will so set before her eyes that beauty by which you
      set so little store, that resentment will lead her to do what she durst
      not think of had you treated her well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman, however, having bestowed his heart elsewhere, made light of
      what the lady said, and notwithstanding her admonitions, continued to lead
      the same life as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when two or three years had gone by, his wife became one of the most
      beautiful women ever seen in France, so that she was reputed to have no
      equal at the Court. And the more she felt herself worthy of being loved,
      the more distressed she was to find that her husband paid no attention to
      her; and so great became her affliction that, but for the consolations of
      her mistress, she had well-nigh been in despair. After trying every
      possible means to please her husband, she reflected that his inclinations
      must needs be directed elsewhere, for otherwise he could not but respond
      to the deep love that she bore him. Thereupon she made such skilful
      inquiries that she discovered the truth, namely, that he was every night
      so fully occupied in another quarter that he could give no thought to his
      wife or to his conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having thus obtained certain knowledge of the manner of life he led, she
      fell into such deep melancholy, that she would not dress herself otherwise
      than in black or attend any place of entertainment. Her mistress, who
      perceived this, did all that in her lay to draw her from such a mood, but
      could not. And although her husband was made acquainted with her state, he
      showed himself more inclined to make light of it than to relieve it.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are aware, ladies, that just as extreme joy will give occasion to
      tears, so extreme grief finds an outlet in some joy. In this wise it
      happened that a great lord who was near akin to the lady&rsquo;s mistress, and
      who often visited her, hearing one day of the strange fashion in which she
      was treated by her husband, pitied her so deeply that he desired to try to
      console her; and on speaking to her, found her so handsome, so sensible,
      and so virtuous, that he became far more desirous of winning her favour
      than of talking to her about her husband, unless it were to show her what
      little cause she had to love him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady, finding that, though forsaken by the man who ought to have loved
      her, she was on the other hand loved and sought after by so handsome a
      Prince, deemed herself very fortunate in having thus won his favour. And
      although she still desired to preserve her honour, she took great pleasure
      in talking to him and in reflecting that she was loved and prized, for
      these were two things for which, so to speak, she hungered.
    </p>
    <p>
      This friendship continued for some time, until it came to the knowledge of
      the King, who had so much regard for the lady&rsquo;s husband that he was
      unwilling he should be put to any shame or vexation. He therefore
      earnestly begged the Prince to forego his inclinations, threatening him
      with his displeasure should he continue to press his suit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince, who set the favour of the King above all the ladies in the
      world, promised for his sake to lay aside the enterprise, and to go that
      very evening and bid the lady farewell. This he did as soon as he knew
      that she had retired to her own apartments, over which was the room of the
      gentleman, her husband. And the husband being that evening at his window,
      saw the Prince going into his wife&rsquo;s room beneath. The Prince saw him
      also, but went in for all that, and in bidding farewell to her whose love
      was but beginning, pleaded as his sole reason the King&rsquo;s command.
    </p>
    <p>
      After many tears and lamentations and regrets, which lasted until an hour
      after midnight, the lady finally said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I praise God, my lord, that it pleases Him you should lose your love for
      me, since it is so slight and weak that you are able to take it up and lay
      it down at the command of man. For my own part, I have never asked
      mistress or husband or even myself for permission to love you; Love, aided
      by your good looks and courtesy, gained such dominion over me that I could
      recognise no God or King save him. But since your heart is not so full of
      true love that fear may not find room in it, you can be no perfect lover,
      and I will love none that is imperfect so perfectly as I had resolved to
      love you. Farewell, then, my lord, seeing that you are too timorous to
      deserve a love as frank as mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Prince went away in tears, and looking back he again noticed the
      husband, who was still at the window, and had thus seen him go in and come
      out again. Accordingly he told him on the morrow why he had gone to see
      his wife, and of the command that the King had laid upon him, whereat the
      gentleman was well pleased, and gave thanks to the King.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, finding that his wife was becoming more beautiful every day,
      whilst he himself was growing old and less handsome than before, he began
      to change his tactics, and to play the part which he had for a long time
      imposed upon his wife, bestowing some attention upon her and seeking her
      more frequently than had been his wont. But the more she was sought by him
      the more was he shunned by her; for she desired to pay him back some part
      of the grief that he had caused her by his indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, being unwilling to forego so soon the pleasure that love was
      beginning to afford her, she addressed herself to a young gentleman, who
      was so very handsome, well-spoken, and graceful that he was loved by all
      the ladies of the Court. And by complaining to him of the manner in which
      she had been treated, she lured him to take pity upon her, so that he left
      nothing untried in his attempts to comfort her. She, on her part, to
      console herself for the loss of the Prince who had forsaken her, set
      herself to love this gentleman so heartily that she came to forget her
      former grief, and to think of nothing but the skilful conduct of her new
      amour, in which she succeeded so well that her mistress perceived nought
      of it, for she was careful not to speak to her lover in her mistress&rsquo;s
      presence. When she wished to talk with him she would betake herself to the
      rooms of some ladies who lived at the Court, amongst whom was one that her
      husband made a show of being in love with.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now one dark evening she stole away after supper, without taking any
      companion with her, and repaired to the apartment belonging to these
      ladies, where she found the man whom she loved better than herself. She
      sat down beside him, and leaning upon a table they conversed together
      while pretending to read in the same book. Some one whom her husband had
      set to watch then went and reported to him whither his wife was gone.
      Being a prudent man, he said nothing, but as quickly as possible betook
      himself to the room, where he found his wife reading the book. Pretending,
      however, not to see her, he went straight to speak to the other ladies,
      who were in another part of the room. But when his poor wife found herself
      discovered by him in the company of a gentleman to whom she had never
      spoken in his presence, she was in such confusion that she quite lost her
      wits; and being unable to pass along the bench, she leaped upon the table
      and fled as though her husband were pursuing her with a drawn sword. And
      then she went in search of her mistress, who was just about to withdraw to
      her own apartments.
    </p>
    <p>
      When her mistress was undressed, and she herself had retired, one of her
      women brought her word that her husband was inquiring for her. She
      answered plainly that she would not go, for he was so harsh and strange
      that she dreaded lest he should do her some harm.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, however, for fear of worse, she consented to go. Her husband said
      not a word to her until they were in bed together, when being unable to
      dissemble so well as he, she began to weep. And when he asked her the
      cause of this, she told him that she was afraid lest he should be angry at
      having found her reading in company with a gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then replied that he had never forbidden her to speak to a man, and did
      not take it ill that she had done so; but he did indeed take it ill that
      she had run from him as though she had done something deserving of
      censure, and her flight and nothing else had led him to think that she was
      in love with the gentleman. He therefore commanded her never to speak to
      him again in public or in private, and assured her that the first time she
      did so he would slay her without mercy or compassion. She very readily
      promised to obey, and made up her mind not to be so foolish another time.
    </p>
    <p>
      But things are desired all the more for being forbidden, and it was not
      long before the poor woman had forgotten her husband&rsquo;s threats and her own
      promises. That very same evening she sent to the gentleman, begging him to
      visit her at night. But the husband, who was so tormented by jealousy that
      he could not sleep, and who had heard say that the gentleman visited his
      wife at night, wrapped himself in a cloak, and taking a valet with him,
      went to his wife&rsquo;s apartment and knocked at the door. She, not in the
      least expecting him, got up alone, put on furred slippers and a
      dressing-gown which were lying close at hand, and finding that the three
      or four women whom she had with her were asleep, went forth from her room
      and straight to the door at which she had heard the knocking. On her
      asking, &ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo; she received in answer the name of her lover; but
      to be still more certain, she opened a little wicket, saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you be the man you say you are, show me your hand, and I shall
      recognise it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And when she touched her husband&rsquo;s hand she knew who it was, and quickly
      shutting the wicket, cried out&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, sir! it is your hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The husband replied in great wrath&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; it is the hand that will keep faith with you. Do not fail,
      therefore, to come when I send for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words he went away to his own apartment, whilst she, more dead
      than alive, went back into her room, and cried out aloud to her
      servant-women, &ldquo;Get up, my friends; you have slept only too well for me,
      for thinking to trick you, I have myself been tricked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words she swooned away in the middle of the room. The women
      rose at her cry, and were so astonished at seeing their mistress stretched
      upon the floor, as well as at hearing the words, she had uttered, that
      they were at their wits&rsquo; end, and sought in haste for remedies to restore
      her. When she was able to speak, she said to them&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see before you, my friends, the most unhappy creature in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And thereupon she went on to tell them the whole adventure, and begged of
      them to help her, for she counted her life as good as lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      While they were seeking to comfort her, a valet came with orders that she
      was to repair to her husband instantly. Thereupon, clinging to two of her
      women, she began to weep and wail, begging them not to suffer her to go,
      for she was sure she would be killed. But the valet assured her to the
      contrary, offering to pledge his life that she should receive no hurt.
      Seeing that she lacked all means of resistance, she at last threw herself
      into the servant&rsquo;s arms, and said to him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since it may not be otherwise, you must e&rsquo;en carry this hapless body to
      its death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Half fainting in her distress, she was then at once borne by the valet to
      his master&rsquo;s apartment. When she reached it, she fell at her husband&rsquo;s
      feet, and said to him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beseech you, sir, have pity on me, and I swear to you by the faith I
      owe to God that I will tell you the whole truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Fore God you shall,&rdquo; he replied, like one beside himself, and forthwith
      he drove all the servants from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having always found his wife very devout, he felt sure that she would not
      dare to forswear herself on the Holy Cross. He therefore sent for a very
      beautiful crucifix that belonged to him, and when they were alone
      together, he made her swear upon it that she would return true replies to
      his questions. Already, however, she had recovered from her first dread of
      death, and taking courage, she resolved that if she was to die she would
      make no concealment of the truth, but at the same time would say nothing
      that might injure the gentleman she loved. Accordingly, having heard all
      the questions that her husband had to put to her, she replied as follows&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no desire, sir, either to justify myself or to lessen to you the
      love that I have borne to the gentleman you suspect; for if I did, you
      could not and you should not believe me. Nevertheless, I desire to tell
      you the cause of this affection. Know, then, sir, that never did wife love
      husband more than I loved you, and that from the time I wedded you until I
      reached my present age, no other passion ever found its way into my heart.
      You will remember that while I was still a child, my parents wished to
      marry me to one richer and more highly born than yourself, but they could
      never gain my consent to this from the moment I had once spoken to you. In
      spite of all their objections I held fast to you, and gave as little heed
      to your poverty as to their remonstrances. You cannot but know what
      treatment I have had at your hands hitherto, and the fashion in which you
      have loved and honoured me; and this has caused me so much grief and
      discontent that but for the succour of the lady with whom you placed me, I
      should have been in despair. But at last, finding myself fully grown and
      deemed beautiful by all but you, I began to feel the wrong you did me so
      keenly that the love I had for you changed into hate, and the desire of
      obeying you into one for revenge. In this despairing condition I was found
      by a Prince who, being more anxious to obey the King than Love, forsook me
      just as I was beginning to feel my pangs assuaged by an honourable
      affection. When the Prince had left me, I lighted upon this present
      gentleman; and he had no need to entreat me, for his good looks,
      nobleness, grace, and virtue are well worthy of being sought after and
      courted by all women of sound understanding. At my instance, not at his
      own, he has loved me in all virtue, so that never has he sought from me
      aught that honour might refuse. And although I have but little cause to
      love you, and so might be absolved from being loyal and true to you, my
      love of God and of my honour has hitherto sufficed to keep me from doing
      aught that would call for confession or shame. I will not deny that I went
      into a closet as often as I could to speak with him, under pretence of
      going thither to say my prayers, for I have never trusted the conduct of
      this matter to any one, whether man or woman. Further, I will not deny
      that when in so secret a place and safe from all suspicion I have kissed
      him with more goodwill than I kiss you. But as I look to God for mercy, no
      other familiarity has passed between us; he has never urged me to it, nor
      has my heart ever desired it; for I was so glad at seeing him that
      methought the world contained no greater pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, sir, will you, who are the sole cause of my misfortune, take
      vengeance for conduct of which you have yourself long since set me an
      example, with, indeed, this difference, that in your case you thought
      nought of either honour or conscience; for you know and I know too that
      the woman you love does not rest content with what God and reason enjoin.
      And albeit the law of man deals great dishonour to wives who love other
      men than their husbands, the law of God does not exempt from punishment
      the husbands who love other women than their wives. And if my offences are
      to be weighed against yours, you are more to blame than I, for you are a
      wise and experienced man, and of an age to know and to shun evil, whilst I
      am young and have no experience of the might and power of love. You have a
      wife who desires you, honours you, and loves you more than her own life;
      while I have a husband who avoids me, hates me, and rates me as lightly as
      he would a servant maid. You are in love with a woman who is already old,
      of meagre figure, and less fair than I; whilst I love a gentleman younger,
      handsomer, and more amiable than you. You love the wife of one of the best
      friends you have in the world, the mistress, moreover, of your King and
      master, so that you offend against the friendship that is due to the
      first, and the respect that is due to the second; whereas I am in love
      with a gentleman whose only tie is his love for me. Judge then fairly
      which of us two is the more worthy of punishment or pardon: you, a man of
      wisdom and experience, who through no provocation on my part have acted
      thus ill not only towards me, but towards the King, to whom you are so
      greatly indebted; or I, who am young and ignorant, who am slighted and
      despised by you, and loved by the handsomest and most worshipful gentleman
      in France, a gentleman whom I have loved in despair of ever being loved by
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the husband heard her utter these truths with so fair a countenance,
      and with such a bold and graceful assurance as clearly testified that she
      neither dreaded nor deserved any punishment, he was overcome with
      astonishment, and could find nothing to reply except that a man&rsquo;s honour
      and a woman&rsquo;s were not the same thing. However, since she swore to him
      that there had been nothing between herself and her lover but what she had
      told him, he was not minded to treat her ill, provided she would act so no
      more, and that they both put away the memory of the past. To this she
      agreed, and they went to bed in harmony together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning an old damosel who was in great fear for her mistress&rsquo;s life
      came to her at her rising, and asked&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, madam, and how do you fare?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would have you know,&rdquo; said her mistress, laughing, &ldquo;that there is not a
      better husband than mine, for he believed me on my oath.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so five or six days passed by.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the husband had such care of his wife that he caused a watch to
      be kept on her both night and day. But for all his care he could not
      prevent her from again speaking with her lover in a dark and suspicious
      place. However, she contrived matters with such secrecy that no one,
      whether man or woman, could ever learn the truth, though a rumour was
      started by some serving-man about a gentleman and a lady whom he had found
      in a stable underneath the rooms belonging to the mistress of the lady in
      question. At this her husband&rsquo;s suspicions were so great that he resolved
      to slay the gentleman, and gathered together a large number of his
      relations and friends to kill him if he was anywhere to be found. But the
      chief among his kinsmen was so great a friend of the gentleman whom they
      sought, that instead of surprising him he gave him warning of all that was
      being contrived against him, for which reason the other, being greatly
      liked by the whole Court, was always so well attended that he had no fear
      of his enemy&rsquo;s power, and could not be taken unawares and attacked.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, he betook himself to a church to meet his lady&rsquo;s mistress, who
      had heard nothing of all that had passed, for the lovers had never spoken
      together in her presence. But the gentleman now informed her of the
      suspicion and ill-will borne him by the lady&rsquo;s husband, and told her that
      although he was guiltless he had nevertheless resolved to go on a long
      journey in order to check the rumours, which were beginning greatly to
      increase. The Princess, his lady&rsquo;s mistress, was much astonished on
      hearing this tale, and protested that the husband was much in the wrong to
      suspect so virtuous a wife, and one in whom she had ever found all worth
      and honour. Nevertheless, considering the husband&rsquo;s authority, and in
      order to quell these evil reports, she advised him to absent himself for a
      time, assuring him that for her part she would never believe such foolish
      suspicions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both the gentleman and the lady, who was present, were well pleased at
      thus preserving the favour and good opinion of the Princess, who further
      advised the gentleman to speak with the husband before his departure. He
      did as he was counselled, and meeting with the husband in a gallery close
      to the King&rsquo;s apartment, he assumed a bold countenance, and said to him
      with all the respect due to one of high rank&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All my life, sir, I have desired to do you service, and my only reward is
      to hear that last evening you lay in wait to kill me. I pray you, sir,
      reflect that while you have more authority and power than I have, I am
      nevertheless a gentleman even as you are. It would be grievous to me to
      lose my life for naught. I pray you also reflect that you have a wife of
      great virtue, and if any man pretend the contrary I will tell him that he
      has foully lied. For my part, I can think of nothing that I have done to
      cause you to wish me ill. If, therefore, it please you, I will remain your
      faithful servant; if not, I am that of the King, and with that I may well
      be content.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The husband replied that he had in truth somewhat suspected him, but he
      deemed him so gallant a man that he would rather have his friendship than
      his enmity; and bidding him farewell, cap in hand, he embraced him like a
      dear friend. You may imagine what was said by those who, the evening
      before, had been charged to kill the gentleman, when they beheld such
      tokens of respect and friendship. And many and diverse were the remarks
      that each one made.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this manner the gentleman departed, and as he had far less money than
      good looks, his mistress delivered to him a ring that her husband had
      given her of the value of three thousand crowns; and this he pledged for
      fifteen hundred.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some time after he was gone, the husband came to the Princess, his wife&rsquo;s
      mistress, and prayed her to grant his wife leave to go and dwell for a
      while with one of his sisters. This the Princess thought very strange, and
      so begged him to tell her the reasons of his request, that he told her
      part of them, but not all. When the young lady had taken leave of her
      mistress and of the whole Court without shedding any tears or showing the
      least sign of grief, she departed on her journey to the place whither her
      husband desired her to go, travelling under the care of a gentleman who
      had been charged to guard her closely, and above all not to suffer her to
      speak on the road to her suspected lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew of these instructions, and every day was wont to cause false
      alarms, scoffing at her custodians and their lack of care. Thus one day,
      on leaving her lodging, she fell in with a Grey Friar on horseback, with
      whom, being herself on her palfrey, she talked on the road the whole time
      from the dinner to the supper hour. And when she was a quarter of a league
      from the place where she was to lodge that night, she said to him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, father, are two crowns which I give you for the consolation you
      have afforded me this afternoon. They are wrapped in paper, for I well
      know that you would not venture to touch them. (2) And I beg you to leave
      the road as soon as you have parted from me, and to take care that you are
      not seen by those who are with me. I say this for your own welfare, and
      because I feel myself beholden to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     2  The Grey Friars belonging to a mendicant order were
     prohibited from demanding or accepting money; it was only
     allowable for them to receive gifts in kind, mainly edible
     produce. It was for this reason that the lady gave the friar
     the two crowns wrapped in paper, knowing that he ought not
     to touch the coins.&mdash;M. See also vol. i. p. 98, note 3.
</pre>
    <p>
      The friar, well pleased with the two crowns, set off across the fields at
      full gallop; and when he was some distance away the lady said aloud to her
      attendants&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may well deem yourselves good servants and diligent guards. He as to
      whom you were to be so careful has been speaking to me the whole day, and
      you have suffered him to do so. Your good master, who puts so much trust
      in you, should give you the stick rather than give you wages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the gentleman who had charge of her heard these words he was so angry
      that he could not reply, but calling two others to him, set spurs to his
      horse, and rode so hard that he at last reached the friar, who on
      perceiving his pursuers had fled as fast as he could. However, the poor
      fellow was caught, being less well mounted than they were. He was quite
      ignorant of what it all meant, and cried them mercy, taking off his hood
      in order that he might entreat them with bareheaded humility. Thereupon
      they realised that he was not the man whom they sought, and that their
      mistress had been mocking them. And this she did with even better effect
      upon their return to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are fitting fellows,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;to receive ladies in your charge.
      You suffer them to talk to any stranger, and then, believing whatever they
      may say, you go and insult the ministers of God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After all these jests they arrived at the place that her husband had
      commanded, and here her two sisters-in-law, with the husband of one of
      them, kept her in great subjection.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meanwhile her husband had heard how his ring had been pledged for
      fifteen hundred crowns, whereat he was exceedingly wrathful, and in order
      to save his wife&rsquo;s honour and to get back the ring, he bade his sisters
      tell her to redeem it, he himself paying the fifteen hundred crowns.
    </p>
    <p>
      She cared nought for the ring since her lover had the money, but she wrote
      to him saying that she was compelled by her husband to redeem it, and in
      order that he might not suppose she was doing this through any lessening
      of her affection, she sent him a diamond which her mistress had given,
      her, and which she liked better than any ring she had.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon the gentleman forwarded her the merchant&rsquo;s bond right willingly;
      deeming himself fortunate in having fifteen hundred crowns and a diamond,
      (3) and at being still assured of his lady&rsquo;s favour. However, as long as
      the husband lived, he had no means of communing with her save by writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the husband died, expecting to find her still what she had promised
      him to be, he came in all haste to ask her in marriage; but he found that
      his long absence had gained him a rival who was loved better than himself.
      His sorrow at this was so great that he henceforth shunned the
      companionship of ladies and sought out scenes of danger, and so at last
      died in as high repute as any young man could have. (4)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     3  The gentleman deemed it only natural that the woman he
     honoured with his love should present him with money. In the
     seventeenth century similar opinions were held, if one may
     judge by some passages in Dancourt&rsquo;s comedies, and by the
     presents which the Duchess of Cleveland made to Henry
     Jerrayn and John Churchill, afterwards Duke of Marlborough,
     as chronicled in the <i>Memoirs of the Count de Gramont</i>.&mdash;M.

     4  Brantôme tells a somewhat similar tale to this in his
     <i>Vies des Dames Galantes</i> (Dis. I.): &ldquo;I knew,&rdquo; he writes,
     &ldquo;two ladies of the Court, sisters-in-law to one another, one
     of whom was married to a courtier, high in favour and very
     skilful, but who did not make as much account of his wife as
     by reason of her birth he should have done, for he spoke to
     her in public as he might have spoken to a savage, and
     treated her most harshly. She patiently endured this for
     some time, until indeed her husband lost some of his credit,
     when, watching for and taking the opportunity, she quickly
     repaid him for all the disdain that he had shown her. And
     her sister-in-law imitated her and did likewise; for having
     been married when of a young and tender age, her husband
     made no more account of her than if she had been a little
     girl.... But she, advancing in years, feeling her heart beat
     and becoming conscious of her beauty, paid him back in the
     same coin, and made him a present of a fine pair of horns,
     by way of interest for the past&rdquo;&mdash;Lalanne&rsquo;s <i>OEuvres de
     Brantôme</i>, vol. ix. p. 157.&mdash;L.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In this tale, ladies, I have tried, without sparing our own sex, to show
      husbands that wives of spirit yield rather to vengeful wrath than to the
      sweetness of love. The lady of whom I have told you withstood the latter
      for a great while, but in the end succumbed to despair. Nevertheless, no
      woman of virtue should yield as she did, for, happen what may, no excuse
      can be found for doing wrong. The greater the temptations, the more
      virtuous should one show oneself, by resisting and overcoming evil with
      good, instead of returning evil for evil; and this all the more because
      the evil we think to do to another often recoils upon ourselves. Happy are
      those women who display the heavenly virtues of chastity, gentleness,
      meekness, and long-suffering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me, Longarine,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;that the lady of whom you have
      spoken was impelled by resentment rather than by love; for had she loved
      the gentleman as greatly as she appeared to do, she would not have
      forsaken him for another. She may therefore be called resentful,
      vindictive, obstinate, and fickle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all very well for you to talk in that way,&rdquo; said Ennasuite, &ldquo;but
      you do not know the heartbreak of loving without return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;that I have had but little experience in that
      way. If I am shown the slightest disfavour, I forthwith forego lady and
      love together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;is well enough for you who love only your own
      pleasure; but a virtuous wife cannot thus forsake her husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet,&rdquo; returned Simontault, &ldquo;the lady in the story forgot for a while that
      she was a woman. No man could have taken a more signal revenge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does not follow,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;because one woman lacks discretion
      that all the rest are the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; said Saffredent, &ldquo;you are all women, as any one would find
      who looked carefully, despite all the fine clothes you may wear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we were to listen to you,&rdquo; said Nomerlide, &ldquo;we should spend the day in
      disputes. For my part, I am so impatient to hear another tale, that I beg
      Longarine to give some one her vote.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Longarine looked at Geburon and said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you know anything about a virtuous woman, I pray you set it forth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since I am to do what I can,&rdquo; said Geburon, &ldquo;I will tell you a tale of
      something that happened in the city of Milan.&rdquo;

      <i>TALE XVI</i>.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>A lady of Milan, widow of an Italian Count, had resolved never again to
      marry or to love. But for three years she was so earnestly wooed by a
      French gentleman, that after repeated proof of the steadfastness of his
      love, she granted him what he had so greatly desired, and they vowed to
      each other everlasting affection</i>. (l)
    </p>
    <p>
      In the days of the Grand Master of Chaumont, (2) there lived a lady who
      was reckoned one of the most honourable women that there were at that time
      in the city of Milan. She had married an Italian Count, and being left a
      widow, lived in the house of her brothers-in-law, refusing to hear speak
      of another marriage. And so discreetly and piously did she demean herself
      that there was none in the Duchy, whether French or Italian, but held her
      in high esteem.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  According to M. de Lincy, who points out that Bonnivet
     must be the hero of the adventure here related, the
     incidents referred to would have occurred at Milan between
     1501 and 1503; but in M. Lacroix&rsquo;s opinion they would be
     posterior to 1506.&mdash;Ed.

     2  See <i>ante</i>, note 1 to Tale XIV.
</pre>
    <p>
      One day when her brothers and sisters-in-law offered an entertainment to
      the Grand Master of Chaumont, this widow lady was obliged to be present,
      though she made it her rule not to attend such gatherings when held in
      other places. And when the Frenchmen saw her, they were all admiration for
      her beauty and grace, especially one among them whose name I shall not
      mention; for it will suffice for you to know that there was no Frenchman
      in Italy more worthy of love than he, for he was endowed with all the
      beauties and graces that a gentleman could have. And though he saw that
      the lady wore black crape, and remained with several old women in a corner
      apart from the young ones, yet, having never known what it was to fear
      either man or woman, he set himself to converse with her, taking off his
      mask, and leaving the dance in order to remain in her company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the whole of the evening he did not cease talking to her and to
      the old women, and found more pleasure in doing so than if he had been
      with the most youthful and bravely attired ladies of the Court. So much,
      indeed, was this the case, that when the hour came to withdraw he seemed
      to have not yet had time even to sit down. And although he only spoke to
      the lady on such common matters as were suited to such company, she knew
      very well that he desired to win her favour, and this she resolved to
      guard against by all means in her power, so that he was never afterwards
      able to see her at any banquet or assembly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He inquired about the manner of her life, and found that she often went to
      churches and convents; whereupon he kept such good watch that she could
      never visit them so secretly but he was there before her. And he would
      remain in the church as long as he had the happiness to see her, and all
      the time that she was present would gaze at her so affectionately that she
      could not remain in ignorance of the love he bore her. In order to avoid
      him, she resolved to feign illness for a time, and to hear mass in her own
      house; and at this the gentleman was most sorely grieved, for he had no
      other means of seeing her than at church.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thinking that she had cured him of his habit, she at last returned to the
      churches as before, but love quickly brought tidings of this to the French
      gentleman, who then renewed his habits of devotion. He feared, however,
      that she might again throw some hindrance in his way, and that he might
      not have time to tell her what he would; and so one morning, when she
      thought herself well concealed in a chapel, he placed himself at the end
      of the altar at which she was hearing mass; and seeing that she was but
      scantily attended, he turned towards her just as the priest was elevating
      the host, and in a soft and loving voice said to her&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I be sent to perdition, madam, by Him whom the priest has now in his
      hands, if you are not causing my death. Though you take from me all means
      of speaking with you, you cannot be ignorant of my desire; my wearied eyes
      and my deathly face must make the truth apparent to you.&rdquo; (3)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     3  The Queen of Navarre is known to have had a considerable
     knowledge of the Italian language, and it is therefore quite
     possible that she was acquainted with the story of
     Poliphilus and Polia, which, although no French translation
     of it appeared until 1554, had been issued at Venice as
     early as 1499. In any case, however, there is a curious
     similarity between the speech of the French gentleman given
     above and the discourse which Poliphilus addresses to Polia
     when he finds her saying her prayers in the temple. A
     considerable portion of the Italian story is in keeping with
     the character of the <i>Heptameron</i> tales.&mdash;M.
</pre>
    <p>
      The lady pretended not to understand him, and replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God&rsquo;s name should not thus be taken in vain; but the poets say that the
      gods laugh at the oaths and lies of lovers, and so women who regard their
      honour should not show themselves credulous or compassionate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words she rose up and returned home.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman&rsquo;s anger at these words may well be imagined by such as have
      experienced the like fortune. But having no lack of spirit, he held it
      better to have received this unfavourable reply than to have failed in
      declaring his love, to which he held fast during three years, losing
      neither time nor opportunity in wooing her by letters and in other ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      For three years, however, she vouchsafed him no reply, but shunned him as
      the wolf shuns the hound that is to take him; and this she did through
      fear for her honour and fair fame, and not because she hated him. He
      perceived this so clearly that he pursued her more eagerly than ever; and
      at last, after many refusals, troubles, tortures and despairs, the lady
      took pity upon him for the greatness and steadfastness of his love, and so
      granted him what he had so greatly desired and so long awaited.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had agreed concerning the means to be employed, the French
      gentleman failed not to repair to her house, although in doing so he
      placed his life in great danger, seeing that she and her relations lived
      all together.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, being as skilful as he was handsome, he contrived the matter so
      prudently that he was able to enter the lady&rsquo;s room at the hour which she
      had appointed, and found her there all alone, lying in a beautiful bed;
      but as he was hasting to put off his clothes in order to join her, he
      heard a great whispering at the door, and a noise of swords scraping
      against the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the widow said to him, with the face of one nigh to death&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now is your life and my honour in as great danger as well can be, for I
      hear my brothers outside seeking you to slay you. I pray you, therefore,
      hide yourself under this bed, and when they fail to find you I shall have
      reason to be angry with them for alarming me without just cause.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman, who had never yet known fear, replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what, pray, are your brothers that they should frighten a man of
      mettle? If the whole breed of them were there together, I am sure they
      would not tarry for the fourth thrust of my sword. Do you, therefore, rest
      quietly in bed, and leave the guarding of this door to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he wrapped his cloak about his arm, took his drawn sword in his hand,
      and opened the door so that he might have a closer view of the swords that
      he had heard. When the door was opened, he saw two serving-women, who,
      holding a sword in each hand, had raised this alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; they said to him, &ldquo;forgive us. We were commanded by our mistress to
      act in this manner, but you shall be hindered by us no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seeing that they were women, the gentleman could do no more than bid them
      go to the devil, and shut the door in their faces. Then he got into bed to
      the lady with all imaginable speed, his passion for her being in no wise
      diminished by fear; and forgetting to inquire the reason of this skirmish,
      he thought only of satisfying his desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when daybreak was drawing nigh, he begged his mistress to tell him why
      she had treated him so ill, both in making him wait so long, and in having
      played this last trick upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My intention,&rdquo; she answered, laughing, &ldquo;had been never to love again, and
      I had observed it from the time I became a widow; but, after you had
      spoken to me at the entertainment, your worth led me to change my resolve,
      and to love you as much as you loved me. It is true that honour, which had
      ever guided me, would not suffer me to be led by love to do aught to the
      disparagement of my reputation. But as the poor hind when wounded unto
      death thinks by change of place to change the pain it carries with it, so
      did I go from church to church thinking to flee from him whom I carried in
      my heart, and the proof of whose perfect devotion has reconciled honour
      and love. However, that I might be the more certain that I was giving my
      heart and love to a true man, I desired to make this last proof by means
      of my serving-women. And I vow to you that had I found you so timorous as
      to hide beneath my bed, either for fear of your life or for any other
      reason, I was resolved to rise and go into another room and never see you
      more. But since I have found that you are possessed of more beauty, and
      grace, and virtue, and valour than rumour had given you, and that fear has
      no power over your heart, nor can cool one whit the love you bear me, I am
      resolved to cleave to you for the remainder of my days. I feel sure that I
      could not place life and honour in better hands than those of one whom I
      deem unmatched in every virtue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, just as though the human will could be unchangeable, they vowed and
      promised what was not in their power, namely, perpetual affection. For
      this is a thing that can neither spring up nor abide in the heart of man,
      as only those ladies know who have had experience of how long such
      feelings last. (4)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     4  In Boaistuau&rsquo;s edition of the <i>Heptameron</i> the final part
     of the above sentence is given as follows: &ldquo;And those women
     that have had experience of it know this, and also how long
     such fancies last.&rdquo; An extract from Brantôme in connection
     with the story will be found in the Appendix to this volume,
     D.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, ladies, if you are wise, you will beware of us even as the stag, had
      he understanding, would beware of the hunter; for our glory, happiness,
      and delight is to see you captured in order to rob you of that which is
      more precious to you than life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Geburon,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;since when have you turned preacher? I can
      remember a time when you did not talk after that fashion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is quite true,&rdquo; said Geburon, &ldquo;that I have just spoken contrary to
      what I have always said my life long; but since my teeth are no longer
      able to chew venison, I warn the hapless deer to beware of the hunters, in
      order that I may atone in my old age for all the mischief which I sought
      to do in my youth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We thank you, Geburon,&rdquo; said Nomerfide, &ldquo;for warning us to our profit,
      but for all that we do not feel very greatly beholden to you. You never
      spoke in that way to one you truly loved, and this is a proof that you
      have little love for us, and, moreover, would not have us loved.
      Nevertheless, we hold ourselves as discreet and as virtuous as the ladies
      whom you so long pursued in your youth. But old folk are commonly vain
      enough to think that they have been wiser in their time than those who
      come after them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Nomerfide,&rdquo; said Geburon, &ldquo;will you believe that I have told you
      the truth when the faithlessness of one of your lovers has made you
      acquainted with the evil nature of men?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; said Oisille to Geburon, &ldquo;that the gentleman whom you
      praise so highly for his boldness ought rather to be praised for the
      ardour of his love. So strong is this passion, that it impels the most
      cowardly to embark on enterprises about which the bravest would think
      twice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If, madam,&rdquo; said Saffredent, &ldquo;he&rsquo;had not deemed the Italians to be better
      at talking than acting, me-thinks he had reason to be afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;if he had not had in his heart the fire that
      consumes fear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since you do not deem the boldness of this gentleman altogether worthy of
      praise,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;you doubtless know of some one else more deserving
      of commendation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;the gentleman in the story deserves praise, but I do
      know of one who is more worthy of being admired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pray you, madam,&rdquo; said Geburon, &ldquo;if that be so, take my place and tell
      us the tale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If,&rdquo; began Oisille, &ldquo;a man who showed such boldness against the Milanese
      to save his own life and his mistress&rsquo;s honour is to be esteemed so very
      brave, what shall be said of one who, without any need for it, and from
      pure and simple valour, performed the deed of which I will now tell you?&rdquo;

      <i>TALE XVII</i>.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>King Francis, being urged to banish Count William, who was said to have
      received money to bring about his death, did not suffer it to appear that
      he had any inkling of the scheme, but played the Count so shrewd a trick
      that he himself took leave of the King and went into banishment</i>. (1)
    </p>
    <p>
      To the town of Dijon, in the Duchy of Burgundy, there came a German Count
      to take service with King Francis. He was named William, (2) and was of
      the House of Saxony, which is so closely allied with that of Savoy that
      formerly they were but one. This Count, who was held for as handsome and
      valiant a gentleman as Germany ever knew, was right well received by the
      King, who not only took him into his service, but kept him close to
      himself as a groom of the chamber.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  The incidents of this story are historical. Francis I. is
     known to have sojourned at Dijon in June and July 1521.&mdash;L.

     2  This is William, eldest son of Wolfgang von Furstemberg,
     chamberlain to Maximilian I., and privy counsellor to Philip
     of Austria.&mdash;B. J. Various particulars concerning him are
     given in the Appendix to this volume, E.
</pre>
    <p>
      Now the Lord de la Trémoille, (3) Governor of Burgundy, an old knight and
      a loyal servant to the King, was ever jealous and anxious for his master&rsquo;s
      safety, and was wont to have spies at all points to learn what the King&rsquo;s
      enemies were doing; and so prudently did he contrive matters, that but few
      things were hidden from him. Among his informations there came to him one
      day a letter from a friend telling him that Count William had received a
      sum of money, with promise of more, for putting the King to death in any
      such manner as he might find possible. (4)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     3  This is Louis II., Sire de la Trémoille, Viscount of
     Thouars and Prince of Talmont, born in 1460. The son of
     Louis I. de la Trémoille and of Margaret d&rsquo;Amboise, he
     became one of the most remarkable men of his time. Favoured
     by Anne de Beaujeu, who arranged his marriage with Gabrielle
     de Bourbon, he commanded the royal troops at the battle of
     St. Aubin du Cormier, in Brittany (1488), at which the
     rebellious Duke of Orleans (afterwards Louis XII.) and the
     Prince of Orange, with a large number of the nobles, their
     partisans, were made prisoners. They were all invited to La
     Trémoille&rsquo;s table after the engagement, and, according to
     Godefroi&rsquo;s Latin history of Louis XII., at the close of the
     repast two Franciscan monks entered the hall, whereupon La
     Trémoille rose and said: &ldquo;Princes, I refer your judgments to
     the King, but as for you, Knights, who have broken your
     faith and falsified your knightly oath, you shall pay for
     your crime with your heads. If you have any remorse on your
     consciences, here are monks who will shrive you.&rdquo; The hall
     resounded with lamentations, but the unhappy nobles were
     promptly dragged into the courtyard, and there put to death;
     both Orleans and Orange being too terror-stricken to
     intercede for them. When the former came to the throne, he
     forgave La Trémoille for his conduct in this affair, and
     showed him great favour, appointing him Governor of Burgundy
     in 1501. La Trémoille also became Admiral of Guienne and
     Brittany, and figured conspicuously in the various Italian
     campaigns of the period. He was killed at Pavia in 1525.
     Jean Bouchet, a contemporary, wrote a curious life of this
     remarkable man, entitled <i>Panegyric du Chevalier sans
     reproche</i>. It will be found in Michaud and Poujoulat&rsquo;s
     <i>Collection de Mitnoires</i>,&mdash;L. and Ed.

     4  It has been suggested that the instigator of this plot
     was Charles V.&lsquo;s famous minister, Cardinal Granvelle.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      The Lord de la Trémoille failed not to give speedy notice of the affair to
      the King, and further made it known to the King&rsquo;s mother, Louise of Savoy,
      who, forgetting that she and this German were akin, begged the King to
      banish him forthwith. But the King bade her speak no more of it, saying
      that it was impossible so upright and honourable a gentleman would
      undertake so vile a deed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some time afterwards a second warning arrived in confirmation of the
      first, and the Governor, burning with love for his master, sought
      permission either to banish the Count or else take him in hand in some
      other fashion; but the King charged him expressly to keep the affair
      secret, being persuaded that he might discover the truth by some other
      means.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day when going a-hunting, the King, as his sole weapon, buckled on the
      finest sword it were possible to see, and took Count William along with
      him, desiring that he would follow him close. After hunting the stag for
      some time, seeing that all his people save the Count were far off, he
      turned out of all the roads and tracks, till he found himself alone with
      the Count in the deepest part of the forest, (5) when, drawing his sword,
      he said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think you that this sword be handsome and trusty?&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     5  This may be either the forest of Argilly or that of
     Mondragon, both in the vicinity of Dijon.&mdash;ED.
</pre>
    <p>
      The Count took it by the point, and answered that he had never seen one
      that he liked better.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; said the King; &ldquo;and I think that, if a gentleman had
      resolved to slay me, he would think twice before he attacked me if he knew
      the strength of my arm, the stoutness-of my heart, and the excellence of
      this sword. Yet, for all that, I should count him but a craven scoundrel
      if, when we were face to face and alone, he durst not execute what he had
      dared to undertake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; replied Count William, with astonished countenance, &ldquo;the
      wickedness of the undertaking would be very great, but the folly of
      seeking to execute it would be no less.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The King laughed, sheathed his sword again, and hearing the hunt hard by,
      spurred after it with all speed. When he reached his train he spoke to
      none of what had passed, but he felt convinced that, although Count
      William was as brave and ready a gentleman as might be, he was not the man
      to carry out so high an enterprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, Count William, fearing that he had been discovered or was at
      least suspected, repaired the next morning to Robertet, Secretary for the
      King&rsquo;s Finances, (6) and told him that he had considered the privileges
      and pay offered him to continue in the King&rsquo;s service, and that they would
      not suffice to support him for half the year. Unless therefore it pleased
      the King to give him double, he would be forced to depart; and he
      accordingly begged the said Robertet to acquaint him as soon as might be
      with the will of the King. To this the Secretary replied that he could not
      better advance the business than by going to the King straightway; and he
      undertook the mission right willingly, for he had seen the warnings that
      the Governor had received.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     6  This is Florimond Robertet, the first of that family of
     statesmen who served the French crown from Charles VIII. to
     Henri III. It was Charles VIII. who appointed Florimond
     Treasurer of France and Secretary of Finances, offices in
     which he displayed great skill and honesty. Louis XII., who
     confirmed him in his functions, habitually consulted him on
     important political affairs. He acquired considerable
     wealth, and was often called &ldquo;the great baron,&rdquo; after the
     barony of Alluye, which he possessed in Le Perche. One of
     the curiosities of Blois is the Hôtel d&rsquo;Alluye, a house of
     semi-Moorish style, erected by Robertet at the close of the
     fifteenth century. Another of his residences was the château
     of Bury, near Blois, where he set up Michael Angelo&rsquo;s famous
     bronze statue of David, presented to him by the city of
     Florence, and the fate of which has furnished material for
     so much speculation. Under Francis I. Robertet enjoyed the
     same credit as during the two previous reigns. Fleuranges
     declares that no one else was so intimate with the King, and
     commends him as being the most experienced and competent
     statesman of the times. According to the <i>Journal d&rsquo;un
     Bourgeois de Paris</i>, Robertet died &ldquo;at the Palais (de
     Justice) in Paris, of which he was concierge,&rdquo; on November
     29, 1527. Francis repeatedly visited him during his illness,
     and, on his death, ordered that his remains should lie in
     state, and be interred with great pomp and ceremony. Clement
     Marot&rsquo;s works contain a poem, four hundred lines in length,
     celebrating Robertet&rsquo;s virtues and talents.&mdash;L., B. J., and
     Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      As soon, therefore, as the King was awake he failed not to lay the matter
      before him in the presence of the Lord de la Trémoille and the Admiral de
      Bonnivet, who were ignorant of the trick that the King had played the
      Count the day before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the King laughed, and said to them&mdash;&ldquo;You desired to banish Count
      William, and you see he is banishing himself. Wherefore, tell him that if
      he be not content with the establishment which he accepted on entering my
      service, and which many men of good families have deemed themselves
      fortunate to have, he must e&rsquo;en seek a better fortune elsewhere. For my
      part, I will in no wise hinder him, but shall be well pleased if he can
      find some condition wherein to live according to his deserts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Robertet was as prompt to bear this answer to the Count as he had been to
      prefer his request to the King. The Count replied that with the King&rsquo;s
      permission he was resolved to depart, and, like one whom fear urges to
      flight, he did not tarry even four and twenty hours; but, just as the King
      was sitting down to table, came to take leave of him, feigning much sorrow
      that his need should force him from the Royal presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He also went to take leave of the King&rsquo;s mother, who parted from him no
      less joyfully than she had formerly received him as a kinsman and friend.
      And thus he returned to his own country; and the King, seeing his mother
      and courtiers in amazement at his sudden departure, told them of the
      fright he had given him, saying that, even if the Count were innocent of
      that which was laid against him, his fear had been sufficiently great to
      constrain him to leave a master whose temper he had not yet come to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my part, ladies, I can see no reason why the King should have been
      moved to risk himself thus against so famous a captain, except that,
      forsaking the company and places where Kings find no inferiors ready to
      give them battle, he desired to place himself on an equal footing with one
      whom he suspected to be his enemy; and this that he might have the
      satisfaction of testing the stoutness and valour of his own heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without a doubt,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;he was in the right; for all the
      praise of man cannot so well satisfy a noble heart as its own particular
      knowledge and experience of the virtues that God has placed in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ancients,&rdquo; said Geburon, &ldquo;long ago showed us that to reach the Temple
      of Fame it was necessary to pass through the Temple of Virtue, and I, who
      am acquainted with the two persons in your tale, know right well that the
      King is indeed one of the most valiant men in his kingdom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By my word,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;at the time when Count William came to France,
      I should have feared his [the King&rsquo;s] sword more than those of the four
      most accomplished Italian gentlemen at Court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We well know,&rdquo; said Ennasuite, &ldquo;that he is too famous for our praises to
      equal his merit, and that the day would be spent before we each could say
      all the good we think of him. And so, madam, I pray you, give your vote to
      one who will tell us some further good of men, if such there be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then said Oisille to Hircan&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me that, as you are so wont to speak ill of women, you will
      find it easy to tell us some good story in praise of a man. I therefore
      give you my vote.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That can I easily do,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;for but a little while since I was
      told a story in praise of a gentleman whose love, constancy and patience
      are so meritorious that I must not suffer them to be forgotten.&rdquo;

      <i>TALE XVIII</i>.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>A young student of noble birth, being smitten with love for
     a very beautiful lady, subdued both love and himself in
     order to achieve his end, and this in spite of many such
     temptations as might have sufficed to make him break his
     promise. And so all his woes were turned to joy by a reward
     suitable to his constant, patient, loyal and perfect love</i>.
     (1)

     1  This story seems to be based on fact, being corroborated
     in its main lines by Brantôme, but there is nothing in the
     narrative to admit of the personages referred to being
     identified.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      In one of the goodly towns of the kingdom of France there dwelt a nobleman
      of good birth, who attended the schools that he might learn how virtue and
      honour are to be acquired among virtuous men. But although he was so
      accomplished that at the age of seventeen or eighteen years he was, as it
      were, both precept and example to others, Love failed not to add his
      lesson to the rest; and, that he might be the better hearkened to and
      received, concealed himself in the face and the eyes of the fairest lady
      in the whole country round, who had come to the city in order to advance a
      suit-at-law. But before Love sought to vanquish the gentleman by means of
      this lady&rsquo;s beauty, he had first won her heart by letting her see the
      perfections of this young lord; for in good looks, grace, sense and
      excellence of speech he was surpassed by none.
    </p>
    <p>
      You, who know what speedy way is made by the fire of love when once it
      fastens on the heart and fancy, will readily imagine that between two
      subjects so perfect as these it knew little pause until it had them at its
      will, and had so filled them with its clear light, that thought, wish and
      speech were all aflame with it. Youth, begetting fear in the young lord,
      led him to urge his suit with all the gentleness imaginable; but she,
      being conquered by love, had no need of force to win her. Nevertheless,
      shame, which tarries with ladies as long as it can, for some time
      restrained her from declaring her mind. But at last the heart&rsquo;s fortress,
      which is honour&rsquo;s abode, was shattered in such sort that the poor lady
      consented to that which she had never been minded to refuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order, however, to make trial of her lover&rsquo;s patience, constancy and
      love, she only granted him what he sought on a very hard condition,
      assuring him that if he fulfilled it she would love him perfectly for
      ever; whereas, if he failed in it, he would certainly never win her as
      long as he lived. And the condition was this:&mdash;she would be willing
      to talk with him, both being in bed together, clad in their linen only,
      but he was to ask nothing more from her than words and kisses.
    </p>
    <p>
      He, thinking there was no joy to be compared to that which she promised
      him, agreed to the proposal, and that evening the promise was kept; in
      such wise that, despite all the caresses she bestowed on him and the
      temptations that beset him, he would not break his oath. And albeit his
      torment seemed to him no less than that of Purgatory, yet was his love so
      great and his hope so strong, sure as he felt of the ceaseless continuance
      of the love he had thus painfully won, that he preserved his patience and
      rose from beside her without having done anything contrary to her
      expressed wish. (2)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     2  Brantôme&rsquo;s <i>Dames Galantes</i> contains an anecdote which is
     very similar in character to this tale: &ldquo;I have heard
     speak,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;of a very beautiful and honourable lady,
     who gave her lover an assignation to sleep with her, on the
     condition that he should not touch her... and he actually
     obeyed her, remaining in a state of ecstasy, temptation and
     continence the whole night long; whereat she was so well
     pleased with him that some time afterwards she consented to
     become his mistress, giving as her reason that she had
     wished to prove his love by his obedience to her
     injunctions; and on this account she afterwards loved him
     the more, for she felt sure that he was capable of even a
     greater feat than this, though it were a very great one.&rdquo;&mdash;
     Lalanne&rsquo;s <i>OEuvres de Brantôme</i>, vol. ix. pp. 6, 7.&mdash;L.
</pre>
    <p>
      The lady was, I think, more astonished than pleased by such virtue; and
      giving no heed to the honour, patience and faithfulness her lover had
      shown in the keeping of his oath, she forthwith suspected that his love
      was not so great as she had thought, or else that he had found her less
      pleasing than he had expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      She therefore resolved, before keeping her promise, to make a further
      trial of the love he bore her; and to this end she begged him to talk to a
      girl in her service, who was younger than herself and very beautiful,
      bidding him make love speeches to her, so that those who saw him come so
      often to the house might think that it was for the sake of this damsel and
      not of herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young lord, feeling sure that his own love was returned in equal
      measure, was wholly obedient to her commands, and for love of her
      compelled himself to make love to the girl; and she, finding him so
      handsome and well-spoken, believed his lies more than other truth, and
      loved him as much as though she herself were greatly loved by him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mistress finding that matters were thus well advanced, albeit the
      young lord did not cease to claim her promise, granted him permission to
      come and see her at one hour after midnight, saying that after having so
      fully tested the love and obedience he had shown towards her, it was but
      just that he should be rewarded for his long patience. Of the lover&rsquo;s joy
      on hearing this you need have no doubt, and he failed not to arrive at the
      appointed time.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the lady, still wishing to try the strength of his love, had said to
      her beautiful damsel&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am well aware of the love a certain nobleman bears to you, and I think
      you are no less in love with him; and I feel so much pity for you both,
      that I have resolved to afford you time and place that you may converse
      together at your ease.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The damsel was so enchanted that she could not conceal her longings, but
      answered that she would not fail to be present.
    </p>
    <p>
      In obedience, therefore, to her mistress&rsquo;s counsel and command, she
      undressed herself and lay down on a handsome bed, in a room the door of
      which the lady left half-open, whilst within she set a light so that the
      maiden&rsquo;s beauty might be clearly seen. Then she herself pretended to go
      away, but hid herself near to the bed so carefully that she could not be
      seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her poor lover, thinking to find her according to her promise, failed not
      to enter the room as softly as he could, at the appointed hour; and after
      he had shut the door and put off his garments and fur shoes, he got into
      the bed, where he looked to find what he desired. But no sooner did he put
      out his arms to embrace her whom he believed to be his mistress, than the
      poor girl, believing him entirely her own, had her arms round his neck,
      speaking to him the while in such loving words and with so beautiful a
      countenance, that there is not a hermit so holy but he would have
      forgotten his beads for love of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when the gentleman recognised her with both eye and ear, and found he
      was not with her for whose sake he had so greatly suffered, the love that
      had made him get so quickly into the bed, made him rise from it still more
      quickly. And in anger equally with mistress and damsel, he said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither your folly nor the malice of her who put you there can make me
      other than I am. But do you try to be an honest woman, for you shall never
      lose that good name through me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying he rushed out of the room in the greatest wrath imaginable, and
      it was long before he returned to see his mistress. However love, which is
      never without hope, assured him that the greater and more manifest his
      constancy was proved to be by all these trials, the longer and more
      delightful would be his bliss.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady, who had seen and heard all that passed, was so delighted and
      amazed at beholding the depth and constancy of his love, that she was
      impatient to see him again in order to ask his forgiveness for the sorrow
      that she had caused him to endure. And as soon as she could meet with him,
      she failed not to address him in such excellent and pleasant words, that
      he not only forgot all his troubles but even deemed them very fortunate,
      seeing that their issue was to the glory of his constancy and the perfect
      assurance of his love, the fruit of which he enjoyed from that time forth
      as fully as he could desire, without either hindrance or vexation. (3)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     3  In reference to this story, Montaigne says in his Essay
     on Cruelty: &ldquo;Such as have sensuality to encounter, willingly
     make use of this argument, that when it is at the height it
     subjects us to that degree that a man&rsquo;s reason can have no
     access... wherein they conceive that the pleasure doth so
     transport us that our reason cannot perform its office
     whilst we are so benumbed and extacied in delight.... But I
     know that a man may triumph over the utmost effort of this
     pleasure: I have experienced it in myself, and have not
     found Venus so imperious a goddess as many&mdash;and some more
     reformed than I&mdash;declare. I do not consider it as a miracle,
     as the Queen of Navarre does in one of the Tales of her
     <i>Heptameron</i> (which is a marvellous pretty book of the
     kind), nor for a thing of extreme difficulty to pass over
     whole nights, where a man has all the convenience and
     liberty he can desire, with a long-coveted mistress, and yet
     be just to his faith first given to satisfy himself with
     kisses and innocent embraces only, without pressing any
     further.&rdquo;&mdash;Cotton&rsquo;s &ldquo;Montaigne&rsquo;s Essays&rdquo;, London, 1743, vol
     ii. pp. 109-10.

    <p>
      &ldquo;I pray you, ladies, find me if you can a woman who has ever shown herself
      as constant, patient and true as was this man. They who have experienced
      the like temptations deem those in the pictures of Saint Antony very small
      in comparison; for one who can remain chaste and patient in spite of
      beauty, love, opportunity and leisure, will have virtue enough to vanquish
      every devil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tis a pity,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;that he did not address his love to a woman
      possessing as much virtue as he possessed himself. Their amour would then
      have been the most perfect and honourable that was ever heard of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But prithee tell me,&rdquo; said Geburon, &ldquo;which of the two trials do you deem
      the harder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think the last,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;for resentment is the strongest of
      all temptations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Longarine said she thought that the first was the most arduous to sustain,
      since to keep his promise it was needful he should subdue both love and
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all very well for you to talk,&rdquo; said Simontault, &ldquo;it is for us who
      know the truth of the matter to say what we think of it. For my own part,
      I think he was stupid the first time and witless the second; for I make no
      doubt that, while he was keeping his promise, to his mistress, she was put
      to as much trouble as himself, if not more. She had him take the oath only
      in order to make herself out a more virtuous woman than she really was;
      she must have well known that strong love will not be bound by commandment
      or oath, or aught else on earth, and she simply sought to give a show of
      virtue to her vice, as though she could be won only through heroic
      virtues. And the second time he was witless to leave a woman who loved
      him, and who was worth more than his pledged mistress, especially when his
      displeasure at the trick played upon him had been a sound excuse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Dagoucin put in that he was of the contrary opinion, and held that
      the gentleman had on the first occasion shown himself constant, patient
      and true, and on the second occasion loyal and perfect in his love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how can we tell,&rdquo; asked Saffredent, &ldquo;that he was not one of those
      that a certain chapter calls <i>de frigidis et malificiatis?</i>&rdquo; (4)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     4  This is an allusion to the penalties pronounced by
     several ecclesiastical Councils, and specified in the
     Capitularies, against those who endeavoured to suspend the
     procreative faculties of their enemies by resorting to
     magic. On this matter Baluze&rsquo;s collection of Capitularies
     (vol. i.) may be consulted. The &ldquo;chapter&rdquo; referred to by
     Margaret is evidently chapter xv. (book vi.) of the
     Decretals of Pope Boniface VIII., which bears the title of
     <i>De frigidis et maleficiatis</i>, and which is alluded to by
     Rabelais in <i>Pantagruel</i>. The belief in the practices in
     question dates back to ancient times, and was shared by
     Plato and Pliny, the latter of whom says that to guard
     against any spell of the kind some wolf fat should be rubbed
     upon the threshold and door jambs of one&rsquo;s bed-chamber. In
     the sixteenth century sorcery of this description was so
     generally believed in, in some parts of France, that
     Cardinal du Perron inserted special prayers against it in
     the ritual. Some particulars on the subject will be found in
     the <i>Admirables Secrets du Petit Albert</i>, and also in a
     <i>Traité d&rsquo;Enchantement</i>, published at La Rochelle in 1591,
     which gives details concerning certain practices alleged to
     take place on the solemnisation of marriage among those of
     the Reformed Church.&mdash;D. and L.

      &ldquo;To complete his eulogy, Hircan ought to have told us how he comported
      himself when he obtained what he wanted, and then we should have been able
      to judge whether it was virtue or impotence that made him observe so much
      discretion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may be sure,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;that had he told me this I should have
      concealed it as little as I did the rest. Nevertheless, from seeing his
      person and knowing his temper, I shall ever hold that his conduct was due
      to the power of love rather than to any impotence or coldness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if he was such as you say,&rdquo; said Simontault, &ldquo;he ought to have
      broken his oath; for, had the lady been angered by such a trifle, it would
      have been easy to appease her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said Ennasuite, &ldquo;perhaps she would not then have consented.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And pray,&rdquo; said Saffredent, &ldquo;would it not have been easy enough to compel
      her, since she had herself given him the opportunity?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Our Lady!&rdquo; said Nomerfide, &ldquo;how you run on! Is that the way to win the
      favour of a lady who is accounted virtuous and discreet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my opinion,&rdquo; said Saffredent, &ldquo;the highest honour that can be paid to
      a woman from whom such things are desired is to take her by force, for
      there is not the pettiest damsel among them but seeks to be long
      entreated. Some indeed there are who must receive many gifts before they
      are won, whilst there are others so stupid that hardly any device or craft
      can enable one to win them, and with these one must needs be ever thinking
      of some means or other. But when you have to do with a woman who is too
      clever to be deceived, and too virtuous to be gained by words or gifts, is
      there not good reason to employ any means whatever that may be at your
      disposal to vanquish her? When you hear it said that a man has taken a
      woman by force, you may be sure that the woman has left him hopeless of
      any other means succeeding, and you should not think any the worse of a
      man who has risked his life in order to give scope to his love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Geburon burst out laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my day,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have seen besieged places stormed because it was
      impossible to bring the garrison to a parley either by money or by
      threats; &lsquo;tis said that a place which begins to treat is half taken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may think,&rdquo; said Ennasuite, &ldquo;that every love on earth is based upon
      such follies as these, but there are those who have loved, and who have
      long persevered in their love, with very different aims.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you know a story of that kind,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;I will give place to you
      for the telling of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do know one,&rdquo; said Ennasuite, &ldquo;and I will very willingly relate it.&rdquo;

    <p>
      An anecdote in keeping with this story will be found in Brantôme&rsquo;s
      miscellaneous works (Petitot&rsquo;s éd., vol. viii. pp. 382-4). The author of
      <i>Les Dames Galantes</i>, after alluding to his aunt Louise de Bourdeille&mdash;who
      was brought up at Court by Anne of Brittany&mdash;proceeds to say:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A certain Grey Friar, who habitually preached before the Queen, fell so
      deeply in love with Mademoiselle de Bourdeille that he completely lost his
      wits, and sometimes in his sermons, whilst speaking of the beauty of the
      holy virgins of past times, he would so forget himself as to say some
      words respecting the beauty of my said aunt, not to mention the soft
      glances which he cast at her. And sometimes, whilst in the Queen&rsquo;s room,
      he would take great pleasure in discoursing to her, not with words of love
      however, for he would have incurred a whipping, but with other covert
      words which tended towards love. My aunt in no wise approved of his
      discourses, and made some mention of them to her own and her companions&rsquo;
      governess. The Queen heard of the matter and could not believe it, on
      account of this man&rsquo;s cloth and holiness. For this reason she kept silent
      until a certain Good Friday, when, in accordance with custom, this friar
      preached before her on the Holy Passion. The ladies and the maids,
      including my aunt, being seated as was their wont before the reverend
      father, in full view of him, he, as though giving out the text and introit
      of his sermon, began to say: &lsquo;It is for you, lovely humanity, it is for
      you that I suffer this day. Thus on a certain occasion spake our Lord
      Jesus Christ.&rsquo; Then proceeding with his sermon the friar chronicled all
      the sufferings and afflictions which Jesus endured for mankind at His
      death upon the Cross, and these he compared to the sufferings that he
      himself endured on account of my aunt; but in such covert, such disguised
      words that even the most enlightened might have failed to understand their
      meaning. Queen Anne, however, who was very expert both in mind and
      judgment, laid hold of this, and took counsel as to the real meaning of
      the sermon, both with certain lords and ladies and certain learned men who
      were there present. They all pronounced the sermon to be most scandalous,
      and the Grey Friar most deserving of punishment; for which reason he was
      secretly chastised and whipped, and then driven away, without any scandal
      being made. Such was the Queen&rsquo;s reply to the amours of this Grey Friar;
      and thus was my aunt well avenged on him for the way in which he had so
      often importuned her. In those times it was not allowable, under divers
      penalties, either to contradict or to refuse to speak to such people, who,
      so it was thought, conversed only of God and the salvation of the soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In Mérimée&rsquo;s Chronique de Charles IX., there will be found a facetious
      sermon by another Grey Friar; this, however, is less in keeping with the
      <i>Heptameron</i>, than with the character of the discourses delivered by
      the preachers of the League.&mdash;M.

      alternately into the convents and noblest abodes of Florence, when, on

      had already helped Alexander to seduce several women of noble birth; and
      to facilitate his assignations had often lent him his house, which
      adjoined the ducal residence in the Via Larga. He engaged to bring the
      Duke the wife of Leonardo Ginori&mdash;sister to his own mother, but much
      younger than she was. Alexander had long been struck with this lady&rsquo;s
      beauty, but so far she had virtuously repulsed him. After supper, however,
      on the day of the feast of the Epiphany, when the Carnival begins,
      Lorenzino informed the Duke that if he would repair to his house,
      unaccompanied and observing the greatest secrecy, he would find Catherine
      Ginori there. Alexander accepted the assignation, dismissed all his
      guards, rid himself of all those who wished to keep a watch upon him, and
      entered Lorenzino&rsquo;s house without being perceived. He was tired and wished
      to rest awhile, but before throwing himself on the bed he unbuckled his
      sword, and Lorenzino, on taking it from him to hang it at the head of the
      bedstead, wound the belt around the hilt in such a fashion that the weapon
      could not be easily drawn from its scabbard. After telling the Duke to
      rest whilst he went to fetch his aunt, he went away, locking the door of
      the room behind him; but returned shortly afterwards with a spadassin,
      nicknamed Scoronconcolo, whom he had previously engaged, for the purpose,
      he said, of ridding him of a great personage of the Court whose name he
      had prudently not given. In fact Lorenzino had carried his design to the
      very point of execution without taking a single person into his
      confidence. On returning into the room, followed by Scoronconcolo, he
      called to the Duke: &lsquo;Are you asleep, my lord?&rsquo; and at the same moment
      transpierced him with a short sword which he was carrying. Alexander,
      although mortally wounded, tried to resist his murderer, whereupon
      Lorenzino, to prevent him from crying out, thrust two of his fingers into
      his mouth, at the same time exclaiming: &lsquo;Be not afraid, my lord.&rsquo;
      Alexander, it appears, bit his assailant&rsquo;s fingers with all the strength
      of his jaws, and holding him in a tight embrace, rolled with him about the
      bed, so that Scoronconcolo was unable to strike the one without striking
      the other. He endeavoured to get at the Duke from between Lorenzino&rsquo;s
      legs, but only succeeded in piercing the mattress, till at last he
      remembered that he had a knife about him, and drove it into the Duke&rsquo;s
      throat, turning it round and round until he eventually killed him. (1)

      &ldquo;Lorenzino failed to reap the fruits of the crime, which he had planned
      with so much skill and such profound secrecy. By the life he had led, he
      had aroused the distrust of all honest folks, he had no friends to whom he
      could apply for advice or help, he had no party behind him, he had never
      been known to display that zeal for liberty which he subsequently
      affected. Although he was the first of the Medici in the order of
      succession, no one thought of him. For his own part, he only thought of
      ensuring his safety. He locked the door of the room, taking the key away
      with him, and having obtained an order for the city gates to be opened,
      and for post-horses to be provided for him, under pretence that he had
      just learned that his brother was ill, in the country, he started for
      Bologna, whence he proceeded to Venice, accompanied by Scoronconcolo.&rdquo;

    <p>
      With reference to this story Brantôme writes as follows in the Sixth
      Discourse of his <i>Vies des Dames Galantes</i>:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the hundred stories of Queen Margaret of Navarre we have a very fine
      tale of that lady of Milan who, having one night given an assignation to
      the late M. de Bonnivet, afterwards Admiral of France, posted her maids
      with drawn swords on the stairs so that they might make a noise there;
      which they did right well, in obedience to the orders of their mistress,
      who for her part feigned great affright, saying that her brothers-in-law
      must have remarked something amiss, that she herself was lost, and that
      he, Bonnivet, ought to hide under the bed or behind the hangings. But M.
      de Bonnivet, without evincing any fear, wrapped his cape round his arm,
      and taking his sword replied: &lsquo;Well, where are these brave brothers who
      want to frighten me, or do me harm? When they see me they will not even
      dare to look at the point of my sword.&rsquo; Then opening the door he rushed
      out, and just as he was about to charge down the staircase he espied the
      women making all this noise; and they, taking fright at sight of him,
      began to cry out and confess everything. M. de Bonnivet, seeing that it
      was nothing more serious, left them, bidding them betake themselves to the
      devil; and then, returning into the room, he closed the door after him and
      went to find his lady, who began to laugh and embrace him, and confess to
      him that it was a trick devised by herself, assuring him that if he had
      behaved as a poltroon, and had not thus displayed the valour which he was
      said to possess, he should never have had her favours.... She was one of
      the most beautiful women of Milan, and he had had a deal of trouble to win
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew a brave gentleman who, one day at Rome, was alone with a pretty
      Roman lady&mdash;her husband being away&mdash;and she gave him a similar
      alarm, causing one of her women to come in hastily to warn her that her
      husband had returned from the country. The lady, feigning astonishment,
      begged the gentleman to hide himself in a closet, as otherwise she would
      be lost. &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; said the gentleman; &lsquo;I would not do that for all the
      wealth in the world; if he comes I will kill him.&rsquo; And as he seized upon
      his sword the lady began to laugh and confess that she had contrived this
      to try him so as to see how he would act, and if he would defend her well
      should her husband seek to do her any harm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I also knew a very beautiful lady who suddenly left a lover she had,
      because she did not find him brave, and took another who did not resemble
      him, but who was extremely feared and redoubted on account of his sword,
      he being one of the best swordsmen that could then be found.&rdquo;&mdash;Lalanne&rsquo;s

      E. (Tale XVII., Page 195.)
    </h2>
    <p>
      Brantome, in the Thirtieth Discourse of his <i>Capitaines Étrangers</i>,
      writes of Furstemberg as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Count William von Furstemberg was accounted a good and valiant captain,
      and would have been more highly esteemed had he not been deficient in
      faith, over greedy and too much addicted to pillage, as he showed once in
      France, when he passed along with his troops; for after his passage there
      was nothing left. He served King Francis for the space of six or seven
      years [not more than six.&mdash;Ed.] with some five companies always
      numbering from six to seven thousand men; however, after this long term of
      services, or rather ravages and pillage, he was suspected of having
      designs against the King&rsquo;s person, as I have elsewhere related, and those
      who would learn more of the matter will find the story in the hundred
      tales of Queen Margaret of Navarre, wherein the valour, generosity and
      magnanimity of that great King are clearly shown. The other, in great
      fear, left his service and entered that of the Emperor (Charles V.). If he
      had not been related to Madame la Régente (Louise of Savoy), through the
      House of Saxony, whence sprang that of Savoy, he would possibly have met
      with the fate he merited, had the King been minded to it; but on this
      occasion the King wished to show his magnanimity rather than have him put
      to death by the officers of justice. Again the King pardoned him when, on
      the arrival of the Emperor at St. Dizier in Champagne, he was taken,
      sounding the river Marne, (2) which he had on other occasions well
      reconnoitred, in coming to or on leaving France with his troops. He was on
      this occasion merely sent to the Bastille, and got quit for a ransom of
      30,000 crowns. Some great captains said and opined that he ought not to
      have been thus treated as a prisoner of war but as a real vile spy, for he
      had professedly acted as such; and they said, moreover, that he got off
      too cheaply at such a ransom, which did not represent the smallest of the
      larcenies that he had perpetrated in France.&rdquo;&mdash;Lalanne&rsquo;s <i>OEuvres
      de Brantôme</i>, vol. i. pp. 349-50.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prior to this affair Furstemberg apparently showed some regret for his
      earlier schemes against Francis I., for Queen Margaret, writing to her
      brother in 1536, remarked:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Count William has asked me to write and tell you that there is a great
      difference between the shameful purgatory of Italy and the glorious
      paradise of this camp, (3) and he spoke to me of his past misdeeds, which
      I would rather he should speak of to you,&rdquo; &amp;c.&mdash;Génin&rsquo;s <i>Lettres
      de Marguerite</i>, p. 321.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     2  This occurred in September 1544. From an unpublished MS.
     in the public library at Rheims it appears that Furstemberg
     was wearing a disguise when captured. The Emperor had sent
     him forward expressly to sound the river. Another
     unpublished MS. at the Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris (<i>anc.
     fol.</i> 8561. f. 22), gives some particulars of his operations
     about this time.&mdash;Ed.

     3  That of Avignon. See vol. i. p. liv.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      In a poetic epistle sent by Margaret to Francis I. in January 1543, to
      celebrate the New Year, there is an allusion to a &ldquo;Conte Guillaume,&rdquo; whom
      Messrs. de Lincy and Montaiglon conjecture to be Furstemberg, though other
      commentators think that the Queen refers to William Poyet, the dishonest
      chancellor, who was sent to the Bastille in 1542 for peculation. We share,
      however, the opinion of Messrs. de Lincy and Montaiglon, as in various
      contemporary MSS. which we have referred to, we have frequently found
      Furstemberg alluded to as &ldquo;Conte&rdquo; and &ldquo;Comte Guillaume,&rdquo; without any
      mention of his surname. The passage in Margaret&rsquo;s epistle alluded to above
      may be thus rendered in prose:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God, fighting for the King in every spot, curses his enemies and brings
      them to shame and ruin, so that none hold them of account; as witness
      &lsquo;Compte [&ldquo;Conte&rdquo; in the MS.] Guillaume,&rsquo; who, in serving the King and the
      kingdom, became rich, feared and highly esteemed. Now, however, a
      fugitive, poor and contemned, he may well meditate as to whence came his
      honours, who it was that maintained him wealthy, happy and feared; and
      thus it is that all the King&rsquo;s enemies are cursed by God in Paradise.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Les
      Marguerites de la Marguerite</i>, 1873, vol. ii. p. 203.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apropos of Furstemberg the following entry occurs in M. de Laborde&rsquo;s <i>Comptes
      des Bâtiments du Roi</i> (vol. ii. p. 229):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paid to Francis de Cadenet, doctor to Count William of Furstemberg, as a
      gift and favour for his services, 30 crowns, value 67 livres 10 sols.&rdquo;&mdash;L.,
      M. and Ed.

      <i>TALE XIX</i>.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Pauline, being in love with a gentleman no less than he was with her,
      and finding that he, because forbidden ever again to speak with her, had
      entered the monastery of the Observance, gained admittance for her own
      part into the convent of St. Clara, where she took the veil; thus
      fulfilling the desire she had conceived to bring the gentleman&rsquo;s love and
      her own to a like ending in respect of raiment, condition and manner of
      life. (1)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the time of the Marquis of Mantua, (2) who had married the sister of
      the Duke of Ferrara, there lived in the household of the Duchess a damsel
      named Pauline, who was greatly loved by a gentleman in the Marquis&rsquo;s
      service, and this to the astonishment of every one; for being poor, albeit
      handsome and greatly beloved by his master, he ought, in their estimation,
      to have wooed some wealthy dame, but he believed that all the world&rsquo;s
      treasure centred in Pauline, and looked to his marriage with her to gain
      and possess it.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1 The incidents related in this tale appear to have taken
     place at Mantua and Ferrara. M. de Montaiglon, however,
     believes that they happened at Lyons, and that Margaret laid
     the scene of her story in Italy, so that the personages she
     refers to might not be identified. The subject of the tale
     is similar to that of the poem called <i>L&rsquo;Amant rendu
     Cordelier à l&rsquo;Observance et Amour</i>, which may perhaps have
     supplied the Queen of Navarre with the plot of her
     narrative.&mdash;M. and Ed.

     2 This was John Francis II. of Gonzaga, who was born in
     1466, and succeeded his father, Frederic I., in 1484. He
     took an active part in the wars of the time, commanding the
     Venetian troops when Charles VIII. invaded Italy, and
     afterwards supporting Ludovico Sforza in the defence of
     Milan. When Sforza abandoned the struggle against France,
     the Marquis of Mantua joined the French king, for whom he
     acted as viceroy of Naples. Ultimately, however, he espoused
     the cause of the Emperor Maximilian, when the latter was at
     war with Venice in 1509, and being surprised and defeated
     while camping on the island of La Scala, he fled in his
     shirt and hid himself in a field, where, by the treachery of
     a peasant who had promised him secrecy, he was found and
     taken prisoner. By the advice of Pope Julius II., the
     Venetians set him at liberty after he had undergone a year&rsquo;s
     imprisonment. In 1490 John Francis married Isabella d&rsquo;Esté,
     daughter of Hercules I. Duke of Ferrara, by whom he had
     several children. He died at Mantua in March 1519, his widow
     surviving him until 1539. Among the many dignities acquired
     by the Marquis in the course of his singularly chequered
     life was that of gonfalonier of the Holy Church, conferred
     upon him by Julius II.&mdash;L. and En.
</pre>
    <p>
      The Marchioness, who desired that Pauline should through her favour make a
      more wealthy marriage, discouraged her as much as she could from wedding
      the gentleman, and often hindered the two lovers from talking together,
      pointing out to them that, should the marriage take place, they would be
      the poorest and sorriest couple in all Italy. But such argument as this
      was by no means convincing to the gentleman, and though Pauline, on her
      side, dissembled her love as well as she could, she none the less thought
      about him as often as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the hope that time would bring them better fortune, this love of
      theirs continued for a long while, during which it chanced that a war
      broke out (3) and that the gentleman was taken prisoner along with a
      Frenchman, whose heart was bestowed in France even as was his own in
      Italy.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     3  This would be the expedition which Louis XII. made into
     Italy in 1503 in view of conquering the Kingdom of Naples,
     and which was frustrated by the defeats that the French army
     sustained at Seminara, Cerignoles, and the passage of the
     Garigliano.&mdash;D.
</pre>
    <p>
      Finding themselves comrades in misfortune, they began to tell their
      secrets to one another, the Frenchman confessing that his heart was a fast
      prisoner, though he gave not the name of its prison-house. However, as
      they were both in the service of the Marquis of Mantua, this French
      gentleman knew right well that his companion loved Pauline, and in all
      friendship for him advised him to lay his fancy aside. This the Italian
      gentleman swore was not in his power, and he declared that if the Marquis
      of Mantua did not requite him for his captivity and his faithful service
      by giving him his sweetheart to wife, he would presently turn friar and
      serve no master but God. This, however, his companion could not believe,
      perceiving in him no token of devotion, unless it were that which he bore
      to Pauline.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of nine months the French gentleman obtained his freedom, and
      by his diligence compassed that of his comrade also, who thereupon used
      all his efforts with the Marquis and Marchioness to bring about his
      marriage with Pauline. But all was of no avail; they pointed out to him
      the poverty wherein they would both be forced to live, as well as the
      unwillingness of the relatives on either side; and they forbade him ever
      again to speak with the maiden, to the end that absence and lack of
      opportunity might quell his passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finding himself compelled to obey, the gentleman begged of the Marchioness
      that he might have leave to bid Pauline farewell, promising that he would
      afterwards speak to her no more, and upon his request being granted, as
      soon as they were together he spoke to her as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven and earth are both against us, Pauline, and hinder us not only
      from marriage but even from having sight and speech of one another. And by
      laying on us this cruel command, our master and mistress may well boast of
      having with one word broken two hearts, whose bodies, perforce, must
      henceforth languish; and by this they show that they have never known love
      or pity, and although I know that they desire to marry each of us
      honourably and to worldly advantage,&mdash;ignorant as they are that
      contentment is the only true wealth,&mdash;yet have they so afflicted and
      angered me that never more can I do them loyal service. I feel sure that
      had I never spoken of marriage they would not have shown themselves so
      scrupulous as to forbid me from speaking to you; but I would have you know
      that, having loved you with a pure and honourable love, and wooed you for
      what I would fain defend against all others, I would rather die than
      change my purpose now to your dishonour. And since, if I continued to see
      you, I could not accomplish so harsh a penance as to restrain myself from
      speech, whilst, if being here I saw you not, my heart, unable to remain
      void, would fill with such despair as must end in woe, I have resolved,
      and that long since, to become a monk. I know, indeed, full well that men
      of all conditions may be saved, but would gladly have more leisure for
      contemplating the Divine goodness, which will, I trust, forgive me the
      errors of my youth, and so change my heart that it may love spiritual
      things as truly as hitherto it has loved temporal things. And if God grant
      me grace to win His grace, my sole care shall be to pray to Him without
      ceasing for you; and I entreat you, by the true and loyal love that has
      been betwixt us both, that you will remember me in your prayers, and
      beseech Our Lord to grant me as full a measure of steadfastness when I see
      you no more, as he has given me of joy in beholding you. Finally, I have
      all my life hoped to have of you in wedlock that which honour and
      conscience allow, and with this hope have been content; but now that I
      have lost it and can never have you to wife, I pray you at least, in
      bidding me farewell, treat me as a brother, and suffer me to kiss you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the hapless Pauline, who had always treated him somewhat rigorously,
      beheld the extremity of his grief and his uprightness, which, amidst all
      his despair, would suffer him to prefer but this moderate request, her
      sole answer was to throw her arms around his neck, weeping so bitterly
      that speech and strength alike failed her, and she swooned away in his
      embrace. Thereupon, overcome by pity, love and sorrow, he must needs swoon
      also, and one of Pauline&rsquo;s companions, seeing them fall one on one side
      and one on the other, called aloud for aid, whereupon remedies were
      fetched and applied, and brought them to themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Pauline, who had desired to conceal her love, was ashamed at having
      shown such transports; yet were her pity for the unhappy gentleman a just
      excuse. He, unable to utter the &ldquo;Farewell for ever!&rdquo; hastened away with
      heavy heart and set teeth, and, on entering his apartment, fell like a
      lifeless corpse upon his bed. There he passed the night in such piteous
      lamentations that his servants thought he must have lost all his relations
      and friends, and whatsoever he possessed on earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning he commended himself to Our Lord, and having divided among
      his servants what little worldly goods he had, save a small sum of money
      which he took, he charged his people not to follow him, and departed all
      alone to the monastery of the Observance, (4) resolved to take the cloth
      there and never more to quit it his whole life long.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     4  The monastery of the Observance here referred to would
     appear to be that at Ferrara, founded by Duke Hercules I.,
     father of the Marchioness of Mantua. The name of
     &ldquo;Observance&rdquo; was given to those conventual establishments
     where the rules of monastic life were scrupulously observed,
     however rigorous they might be. The monastery of the
     Observance at Ferrara belonged to the Franciscan order,
     reformed by the Pope in 1363.&mdash;D. and L.
</pre>
    <p>
      The Warden, who had known him in former days, at first thought he was
      being laughed at or was dreaming, for there was none in all the land that
      less resembled a Grey Friar than did this gentleman, seeing that he was
      endowed with all the good and honourable qualities that one would desire a
      gentleman to possess. Albeit, after hearing his words and beholding the
      tears that flowed (from what cause he knew not) down his face, the Warden
      compassionately took him in, and very soon afterwards, finding him
      persevere in his desire, granted him the cloth: whereof tidings were
      brought to the Marquis and Marchioness, who thought it all so strange that
      they could scarcely believe it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline, wishing to show herself untrammelled by any passion, strove as
      best she might to conceal her sorrow, in such wise that all said she had
      right soon forgotten the deep affection of her faithful lover. And so five
      or six months passed by without any sign on her part, but in the meanwhile
      some monk had shown her a song which her lover had made a short time after
      he had taken the cowl. The air was an Italian one and pretty well known;
      as for the words, I have put them into our own tongue as nearly as I can,
      and they are these:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     What word shall be
     Hers unto me,
     When I appear in convent guise
     Before her eyes?

     Ah! sweet maiden,
     Lone, heart-laden,
     Dumb because of days that were;
     When the streaming
     Tears are gleaming
     &lsquo;Mid the streaming of thy hair,
     Ah! with hopes of earth denied thee,
     Holiest thoughts will heavenward guide thee
     To the hallowing cloister&rsquo;s door.
     What word shall be, &amp;c.

     What shall they say,
     Who wronged us, they
     Who have slain our heart&rsquo;s desire,
     Seeing true love
     Doth flawless prove,
     Thus tried as gold in fire?
     When they see my heart is single,
     Their remorseful tears shall mingle,
     Each and other weeping sore.
     What word shall be, &amp;c.

     And should they come
     To will us home,
     How vain were all endeavour!
     &ldquo;Nay, side by side,
     &ldquo;We here shall bide
     &ldquo;Till soul from soul shall sever.
     &ldquo;Though of love your hate bereaves us
     &ldquo;Yet the veil and cowl it leaves us,
     &ldquo;We shall wear till life be o&rsquo;er.&rdquo;
      What word shall be, &amp;c.

     And should they move
     Our flesh to love
     Once more the mockers, singing
     Of fruits and flowers
     In golden hours
     For mated hearts upspringing;
     We shall say: &ldquo;Our lives are given,
     Flower and fruit, to God in Heaven,
     Who shall hold them evermore.&rdquo;
      What word shall be, &amp;c.

     O victor Love!
     Whose might doth move
     My wearied footsteps hither,
     Here grant me days
     Of prayer and praise,
     Grant faith that ne&rsquo;er shall wither;
     Love of each to either given,
     Hallowed by the grace of Heaven,
     God shall bless for evermore.
     What word shall be, &amp;c.

     Avaunt Earth&rsquo;s weal!
     Its bands are steel
     To souls that yearn for Heaven;
     Avaunt Earth&rsquo;s pride!
     Deep Hell shall hide
     Hearts that for fame have striven.
     Far be lust of earthly pleasure,
     Purity, our priceless treasure,
     Christ shall grant us of His store.
     What word shall be, &amp;c.

     Swift be thy feet,
     My own, my sweet,
     Thine own true lover follow;
     Fear not the veil,
     The cloister&rsquo;s pall
     Keeps far Earth&rsquo;s spectres hollow.
     Sinks the fire with fitful flashes,
     Soars the Phoenix from his ashes,
     Love yields Life for evermore.
     What word shall be, &amp;c.

     Love, that no power
     Of dreariest hour,
     Could change, no scorn, no rage,
     Now heavenly free
     From Earth shall be,
     In this, our hermitage.
     Winged of love that upward, onward,
     Ageless, boundless, bears us sunward,
     To the heavens our souls shall soar.
     What word shall be, &amp;c.

      On reading these verses through in a chapel where she was alone, Pauline
      began to weep so bitterly that all the paper was wetted with her tears.
      Had it not been for her fear of showing a deeper affection than was
      seemly, she would certainly have withdrawn forthwith to some hermitage,
      and never have looked upon a living being again; but her native discretion
      moved her to dissemble for a little while longer. And although she was now
      resolved to leave the world entirely, she feigned the very opposite, and
      so altered her countenance, that in company she was altogether unlike her
      real self. For five or six months did she carry this secret purpose in her
      heart, making a greater show of mirth than had ever been her wont.
    </p>
    <p>
      But one day she went with her mistress to the Observance to hear high
      mass, and when the priest, the deacon and the sub-deacon came out of the
      vestry to go to the high altar, she saw her hapless lover, who had not yet
      fulfilled his year of novitiate, acting as acolyte, carrying the two
      vessels covered with a silken cloth, and walking first with his eyes upon
      the ground. When Pauline saw him in such raiment as did rather increase
      than diminish his comeliness, she was so exceedingly moved and disquieted,
      that to hide the real reason of the colour that came into her face, she
      began to cough. Thereupon her unhappy lover, who knew this sound better
      than that of the cloister bells, durst not turn his head; still on passing
      in front of her he could not prevent his eyes from going the road they had
      so often gone before; and whilst he thus piteously gazed on Pauline, he
      was seized in such wise by the fire which he had considered well-nigh
      quelled, that whilst striving to conceal it more than was in his power, he
      fell at full length before her. However, for fear lest the cause of his
      fall should be known, he was led to say that it was by reason of the
      pavement of the church being broken in that place.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Pauline perceived that the change in his dress had not wrought any
      change in his heart, and that so long a time had gone by since he had
      become a monk, that every one believed her to have forgotten him, she
      resolved to fulfil the desire she had conceived to bring their love to a
      like ending in respect of raiment, condition and mode of life, even as
      these had been akin at the time when they abode together in the same
      house, under the same master and mistress. More than four months
      previously she had carried out all needful measures for taking the veil,
      and now, one morning she asked leave of the Marchioness to go and hear
      mass at the convent of Saint Clara, (5) which her mistress granted her,
      not knowing the reason of her request. But in passing by the monastery of
      the Grey Friars, she begged the Warden to summon her lover, saying that he
      was her kinsman, and when they met in a chapel by themselves, she said to
      him:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     5 There does not appear to have been a church of St. Clara
     at Mantua, but there was one attached to a convent of that
     name at Ferrara.&mdash;M. and D.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had my honour suffered me to seek the cloister as soon as you, I should
      not have waited until now; but having at last by my patience baffled the
      slander of those who are more ready to think evil than good, I am resolved
      to take the same condition, raiment and life as you have taken. Nor do I
      inquire of what manner they are; if you fare well, I shall partake of your
      welfare, and if you fare ill, I would not be exempt. By whatsoever path
      you are journeying to Paradise I too would follow; for I feel sure that He
      who alone is true and perfect, and worthy to be called Love, has drawn us
      to His service by means of a virtuous and reasonable affection, which He
      will by His Holy Spirit turn wholly to Himself. Let us both, I pray you,
      put from us the perishable body of the old Adam, and receive and put on
      the body of our true Spouse, who is the Lord Jesus Christ.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The monk-lover was so rejoiced to hear of this holy purpose, that he wept
      for gladness and did all that he could to strengthen her in her resolve,
      telling her that since the pleasure of hearing her words was the only one
      that he might now seek, he deemed himself happy to dwell in a place where
      he should always be able to hear them. He further declared that her
      condition would be such that they would both be the better for it; for
      they would live with one love, with one heart and with one mind, guided by
      the goodness of God, whom he prayed to keep them in His hand, wherein none
      can perish. So saying, and weeping for love and gladness, he kissed her
      hands; but she lowered her face upon them, and then, in all Christian
      love, they gave one another the kiss of hallowed affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, in this joyful mood Pauline left him, and came to the convent of
      Saint Clara, where she was received and took the veil, whereof she sent
      tidings to her mistress, the Marchioness, who was so amazed that she could
      not believe it, but came on the morrow to the convent to see Pauline and
      endeavour to turn her from her purpose. But Pauline replied that she, her
      mistress, had had the power to deprive her of a husband in the flesh, the
      man whom of all men she had loved the best, and with that she must rest
      content, and not seek to sever her from One who was immortal and
      invisible, for this Was neither in her power nor in that of any creature
      upon earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Marchioness, finding her thus steadfast in her resolve, kissed her and
      left her, with great sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      And thenceforward Pauline and her lover lived such holy and devout lives,
      observing all the rules of their order, that we cannot doubt that He whose
      law is love told them when their lives were ended, as He had told Mary
      Magdalene: &ldquo;Your sins are forgiven, for ye have loved much;&rdquo; and doubtless
      He removed them in peace to that place where the recompense surpasses all
      the merits of man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot deny, ladies, that in this case the man&rsquo;s love was the greater
      of the two; nevertheless, it was so well requited that I would gladly have
      all lovers equally rewarded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;there would be more manifest fools among men and
      women than ever there were.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you call it folly,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;to love virtuously in youth and
      then to turn this love wholly to God?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If melancholy and despair be praiseworthy,&rdquo; answered Hircan, laughing, &ldquo;I
      will acknowledge that Pauline and her lover are well worthy of praise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True it is,&rdquo; said Geburon, &ldquo;that God has many ways of drawing us to
      Himself, and though they seem evil in the beginning, yet in the end they
      are good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Moreover,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;I believe that no man can ever love God
      perfectly that has not perfectly loved one of His creatures in this
      world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by loving perfectly?&rdquo; asked Saffredent. &ldquo;Do you consider
      that those frigid beings who worship their mistresses in silence and from
      afar are perfect lovers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I call perfect lovers,&rdquo; replied Parlamente, &ldquo;those who seek perfection of
      some kind in the objects of their love, whether beauty, or goodness, or
      grace, ever tending to virtue, and who have such noble and upright hearts
      that they would rather die than do base things, contrary and repugnant to
      honour and conscience. For the soul, which was created for nothing but to
      return to its sovereign good, is, whilst enclosed in the body, ever
      desirous of attaining to it. But since the senses, through which the soul
      receives knowledge, are become dim and carnal through the sin of our first
      parent, they can show us only those visible things that approach towards
      perfection; and these the soul pursues, thinking to find in outward
      beauty, in a visible grace and in the moral virtues, the supreme, absolute
      beauty, grace and virtue. But when it has sought and tried these external
      things and has failed to find among them that which it really loves, the
      soul passes on to others; wherein it is like a child, which, when very
      young, will be fond of dolls and other trifles, the prettiest its eyes can
      see, and will heap pebbles together in the idea that these form wealth;
      but as the child grows older he becomes fond of living dolls, and gathers
      together the riches that are needful for earthly life. And when he learns
      by greater experience that in all these earthly things there is neither
      perfection nor happiness, he is fain to seek Him who is the Creator and
      Author of happiness and perfection. Albeit, if God should not give him the
      eye of Faith, he will be in danger of passing from ignorance to infidel
      philosophy, since it is Faith alone that can teach and instil that which
      is right; for this, carnal and fleshly man can never comprehend.&rdquo; (6)
    </p>

     6 The whole of this mystical dissertation appears to have
     been inspired by some remarks in Castiglione&rsquo;s <i>Libro del
     Cortegiano</i>&mdash;which Margaret was no doubt well acquainted
     with, as it was translated into French in 1537 by Jacques
     Colin, her brother&rsquo;s secretary. This work, which indeed
     seems to have suggested several passages in the
     <i>Heptameron</i>, was at that time as widely read in France as
     in Italy and Spain.&mdash;B. J. and D.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you not see,&rdquo; said Longarine, &ldquo;that uncultivated ground which bears
      plants and trees in abundance, however useless they may be, is valued by
      men, because it is hoped that it will produce good fruit if this be sown
      in it? In like manner, if the heart of man has no feeling of love for
      visible things, it will never arrive at the love of God by the sowing of
      His Word, for the soul of such a heart is barren, cold and worthless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Saffredent, &ldquo;is the reason why most of the doctors are not
      spiritual. They never love anything but good wine and dirty, ill-favoured
      serving-women, without making trial of the love of honourable ladies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I could speak Latin well,&rdquo; said Simontault, &ldquo;I would quote you St.
      John&rsquo;s words: &lsquo;He that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can
      he love God whom he hath not seen?&rsquo; (7) From visible things we are led on
      to love those that are invisible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If,&rdquo; said Ennasuite, &ldquo;there be a man as perfect as you say, <i>quis est
      ille et laudabimus eum?</i>&rdquo; (8)
    </p>

      &ldquo;There are men,&rdquo; said Dagoucin, &ldquo;whose love is so strong and true that
      they would rather die than harbour a wish contrary to the honour and
      conscience of their mistress, and who at the same time are unwilling that
      she or others should know what is in their hearts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such men,&rdquo; said Saffredent, &ldquo;must be of the nature of the chameleon,
      which lives on air. (9) There is not a man in the world but would fain
      declare his love and know that it is returned; and further, I believe that
      love&rsquo;s fever is never so great, but it quickly passes off when one knows
      the contrary. For myself, I have seen manifest miracles of this kind.&rdquo;

      mistress the very opposite of his desire.&rdquo;

    <p>
      &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; said Saffredent, &ldquo;so much afraid of displeasing the ladies, whose
      faithful servant I have always been and shall always be, that without an
      express command from themselves I should never have dared to speak of
      their imperfections. However, in obedience to them, I will hide nothing of
      the truth.&rdquo;

      <i>TALE XX</i>.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>The Lord of Riant, being greatly in love with a widow lady and finding
      her the contrary of what he had desired and of what she had often declared
      herself to be, was so affected thereby that in a moment resentment had
      power to extinguish the flame which neither length of time nor lack of
      opportunity had been able to quench.</i> (1)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1 The unpleasant discovery related in this tale is
     attributed by Margaret to a gentleman of Francis I.&lsquo;s
     household, but a similar incident figures in the
     introduction to the <i>Arabian Nights</i>. Ariosto also tells
     much the same tale in canto xxviii. of his <i>Rolando
     Furioso</i>, and another version of it will be found in No. 24
     of Morlini&rsquo;s <i>Novella</i>, first issued at Naples in 1520.
     Subsequent to the <i>Heptameron</i> it supplied No. 29 of the
     <i>Comptes du Monde Adventureux</i>, figured in a rare imitation
     of the <i>Cent Nouvelles Nouvelles</i> printed at Rouen early in
     the seventeenth century, and was introduced by La Fontaine
     into his well-known tale <i>Joconde</i>. On the other hand, there
     is certainly a locality called Rians in Provence, just
     beyond the limits of Dauphiné, and moreover among Francis
     I.&lsquo;s &ldquo;equerries of the stable&rdquo; there was a Monsieur dc Rian
     who received a salary of 200 livres a year from 1522 to
     1529.&mdash;See the roll of the officers of the King&rsquo;s Household
     in the French National Archives, <i>Sect. Histor</i>., K. 98.
     Some extracts from Brantôme bearing on the story will be
     found in the Appendix to this vol. (A).&mdash;L. and En.
</pre>
    <p>
      In the land of Dauphiné there lived a gentleman named the Lord of Riant;
      he belonged to the household of King Francis the First, and was as
      handsome and worshipful a gentleman as it was possible to see. He had long
      been the lover of a widow lady, whom he loved and revered so exceedingly
      that, for fear of losing her favour, he durst not solicit of her that
      which he most desired. Now, since he knew himself to be a handsome man and
      one worthy to be loved, he fully believed what she often swore to him&mdash;namely,
      that she loved him more than any living man, and that if she were led to
      do aught for any gentleman, it would be for him alone, who was the most
      perfect she had ever known. She at the same time begged him to rest
      satisfied with this virtuous love and to seek nothing further, and assured
      him that if she found him unreasonably aiming at more, he would lose her
      altogether. The poor gentleman was not only satisfied, but he deemed
      himself very fortunate in having gained the heart of a lady who appeared
      to him so full of virtue.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would take too long to tell you his love-speeches, his lengthened
      visits to her, and the journeys he took in order to see her; it is enough
      to say that this poor martyr, consumed by so pleasing a fire that the more
      one burns the more one wishes to burn, continually sought for the means of
      increasing his martyrdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day the fancy took him to go post-haste to see the lady whom he loved
      better than himself, and whom he prized beyond every other woman in the
      world. On reaching her house, he inquired where she was, and was told that
      she had just come from vespers, and was gone into the warren to finish her
      devotions there. He dismounted from his horse and went straight to the
      warren where she was to be found, and here he met with some of her women,
      who told him that she had gone to walk alone in a large avenue.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was more than ever beginning to hope that some good fortune awaited
      him, and continued searching for her as carefully and as quietly as he
      could, desiring above all things to find her alone. He came in this way to
      a summer-house formed of bended boughs, the fairest and pleasantest place
      imaginable, (2) and impatient to see the object of his love, he went in;
      and there beheld the lady lying on the grass in the arms of a groom in her
      service, who was as ill-favoured, foul and disreputable as the Lord of
      Riant was handsome, virtuous and gentle.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     2 For a description of a summer-house of the kind referred
     to, see Cap&rsquo;s edition of Palissy&rsquo;s <i>Dessein du Jardin
     Délectable</i>, p. 69. Palissy there describes some summer-
     houses formed of young elmtrees, with seats, columns,
     friezes, and a roofing so cunningly contrived of bent boughs
     that the rain could not penetrate into the interior. It is
     to some such construction that Queen Margaret refers.&mdash;M.
</pre>
    <p>
      I will not try to depict to you his resentment, but it was so great that
      in a moment it had power to extinguish the flame which neither length of
      time nor lack of opportunity had been able to impair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; he said to her, being now as full of indignation as once he had
      been of love, &ldquo;much good may this do you! (3) The revelation of your
      wickedness has to-day cured me, and freed me from the continual anguish
      that was caused by the virtue I believed to be in you.&rdquo; (4)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     3 The French words here are &ldquo;prou face,&rdquo; which in Margaret&rsquo;s
     time were very generally used in lieu of &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; or &ldquo;So be
     it.&rdquo;&mdash;M.

     4 In <i>Joconde</i> La Fontaine gives the end of the adventure as
     follows:&mdash;

     &ldquo;Sans rencontrer personne et sans etre entendu
     Il monte dans sa chambre et voit près de la dame
     Un lourdaud de valet sur son sein étendu.
     Tous deux dormaient. Dans cet abord Joconde
     Voulut les envoyer dormir en l&rsquo;autre monde,
     Mais cependant il n&rsquo;en fit rien
     Et mon avis est qu&rsquo;il fit bien.&rdquo;

     Both in La Fontaine&rsquo;s <i>Conte</i> and in Ariosto&rsquo;s <i>Rolando</i> the
     lady is the Queen, and the favoured lover the King&rsquo;s dwarf.
     &mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      And with this farewell he went back again more quickly than he had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      The unhappy woman made him no other reply than to put her hand to her
      face; for being unable to hide her shame, she covered her eyes that she
      might not see him who in spite of her deceit now perceived it only too
      clearly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so, ladies, if you are not minded to love perfectly, do not, I pray
      you, seek to deceive and annoy an honest man for vanity&rsquo;s sake; for
      hypocrites are rewarded as they deserve, and God favours those who love
      with frankness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;you have kept us a proper tale for the end of the
      day. But that we have all sworn to speak the truth, I could not believe
      that a woman of that lady&rsquo;s condition could be so wicked both in soul and
      in body, and leave so gallant a gentleman for so vile a muleteer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, madam,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;if you knew what a difference there is between
      a gentleman who has worn armour and been at the wars all his life, and a
      well-fed knave that has never stirred from home, you would excuse the poor
      widow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not believe,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;whatever you may say, that you could
      admit any possible excuse for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard,&rdquo; said Simontault, &ldquo;that there are women who like to have
      apostles to preach of their virtue and chastity, and treat them as kindly
      and familiarly as possible, saying that but for the restraints of honour
      and conscience they would grant them their desire. And so these poor
      fools, when speaking in company of their mistresses, swear that they would
      thrust their fingers into the fire without fear of burning in proof that
      these ladies are virtuous women, since they have themselves thoroughly
      tested their love. Thus are praised by honourable men, those who show
      their true nature to such as are like themselves; and they choose such as
      would not have courage to speak, or, if they did, would not be believed by
      reason of their low and degraded position.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Longarine, &ldquo;is an opinion which I have before now heard
      expressed by jealous and suspicious men, but it may indeed be called
      painting a chimera. And even although it be true of one wretched woman,
      the same suspicion cannot attach to all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;the longer we talk in this way, the longer will
      these good gentlemen play the critics over Simontault&rsquo;s tale, and all at
      our own expense. So in my opinion we had better go to vespers, and not
      cause so much delay as we did yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The company agreed to this proposal, and as they were going Oisille said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If any one gives God thanks for having told the truth to-day, Saffredent
      ought to implore His forgiveness for having raked up so vile a story
      against the ladies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By my word,&rdquo; replied Saffredent, &ldquo;what I told you was true, albeit I only
      had it upon hearsay. But were I to tell you all that I have myself seen of
      women, you would have need to make even more signs of the cross than the
      priests do in consecrating a church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Repentance is a long way off,&rdquo; said Geburon, &ldquo;when confession only
      increases the sin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since you have so bad an opinion of women,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;they ought
      to deprive you of their honourable society and friendship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are some women,&rdquo; he returned, &ldquo;who have acted towards me so much in
      accordance with your advice, in keeping me far away from things that are
      honourable and just, that could I do and say worse to them, I should not
      neglect doing so, in order that I might stir them up to revenge me on her
      who does me so much wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whilst he spoke these words, Parlamente put on her mask (5) and went with
      the others into the church, where they found that although the bell had
      rung for vespers, there was not a single monk, present to say them.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     5 Little masks hiding only the upper part of the face, and
     called <i>tourets-de-nez</i>, were then frequently worn by ladies
     of rank. Some verses by Christine de Pisan show them to have
     been in vogue already in the fourteenth century. In the MS.
     copy of Margaret&rsquo;s poem of <i>La Coche</i> presented to the
     Duchess of Etampes, the ladies in the different miniatures
     are frequently shown wearing masks of the kind referred to.
     Some curious particulars concerning these <i>tourets</i> will be
     found in M. Léon do Laborde&rsquo;s <i>Le Palais Mazarin et les
     grandes habitations de ville et de campagne au XVIIe
     Siècle</i>, Paris, 1846, 8vo, p. 314.&mdash;L.

      The monks, indeed, had heard that the company assembled in the meadow to
      tell the pleasantest tales imaginable, and being fonder of pleasure than
      of their prayers, they had gone and hidden themselves in a ditch, where
      they lay flat on their bellies behind a very thick hedge; and they had
      there listened so eagerly to the stories that they had not heard the
      ringing of the monastery bell, as was soon clearly shown, for they
      returned in such great haste that they almost lacked breath to begin the
      saying of vespers.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the service, when they were asked why they had been so late and had
      chanted so badly, they confessed that they had been to listen to the
      tales; whereupon, since they were so desirous of hearing them, it was
      granted that they might sit and listen at their ease every day behind the
      hedge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Supper-time was spent joyously in discoursing of such matters as they had
      not brought to an end in the meadow. And this lasted through the evening,
      until Oisille begged them to retire so that their minds might be the more
      alert on the morrow, after a long, sound sleep, one hour of which before
      midnight was, said she, better than three after it. Accordingly the
      company parted one from another, betaking themselves to their respective
      rooms; and in this wise ended the Second Day.

      PROLOGUE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Though it was yet early when the company entered the hall on the morrow,
      they found Madame Oisille there before them. She had been meditating for
      more than half-an-hour upon the lesson that she was going to read; and if
      she had contented them on the first and second days, she assuredly did no
      less on the third; indeed, but that one of the monks came in search of
      them they would not have heard high mass, for so intent were they upon
      listening to her that they did not even hear the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had piously heard mass, and had dined with temperance to the end
      that the meats might in no sort hinder the memory of each from acquitting
      itself as well as might be when their several turns came, they withdrew to
      their apartments, there to consult their note-books until the wonted hour
      for repairing to the meadow was come. When it had arrived they were not
      slow to make the pleasant excursion, and those who were prepared to tell
      of some merry circumstance already showed mirthful faces that gave promise
      of much laughter. When they were seated, they asked Saffredent to whom he
      would give his vote for the beginning of the Third Day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that since my offence yesterday was as you say very

      able to praise the ladies sufficiently to make you forget such truth as
      you heard from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not undertake,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;to atone for your offences, but
      I will promise not to imitate them. Wherefore, holding to the truth that
      we have promised and vowed to utter, I propose to show you that there are
      ladies who in their loves have aimed at nought but virtue. And since she
      of whom I am going to speak to you came of an honourable line, I will just
      change the names in my story but nothing more; and I pray you, ladies,
      believe that love has no power to change a chaste and virtuous heart, as
      you will see by the tale I will now begin to tell.&rdquo;

      <i>TALE XXI</i>.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>Having remained unmarried until she was thirty years of
     age, Rolandine, recognising her father&rsquo;s neglect and her
     mistress&rsquo;s disfavour, fell so deeply in love with a bastard
     gentleman that she promised him marriage; and this being
     told to her father he treated her with all the harshness
     imaginable, in order to make her consent to the dissolving
     of the marriage; but she continued steadfast in her love
     until she had received certain tidings of the Bastard&rsquo;s
     death, when she was wedded to a gentleman who bore the same
     name and arms as did her own family</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      There was in France a Queen (1) who brought up in her household several
      maidens belonging to good and noble houses. Among others there was one
      called Rolandine, (2) who was near akin to the Queen; but the latter,
      being for some reason unfriendly with the maiden&rsquo;s father, showed her no
      great kindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, although this maiden was not one of the fairest&mdash;nor yet indeed
      was she of the ugliest&mdash;she was nevertheless so discreet and virtuous
      that many persons of great consequence sought her in marriage. They had,
      however, but a cold reply; for the father (3) was so fond of his money
      that he gave no thought to his daughter&rsquo;s welfare, while her mistress, as
      I have said, bore her but little favour, so that she was sought by none
      who desired to be advanced in the Queen&rsquo;s good graces.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  This is evidently Anne of Brittany, elder daughter of Duke
     Francis II. and wife in turn of Charles VIII. and Louis XII.
     Brantôme says: &ldquo;She was the first to form that great Court
     of ladies which we have seen since her time until now; she
     always had a very great suite of ladies and maids, and never
     refused fresh ones; far from it, indeed, for she would
     inquire of the noblemen at Court if they had daughters, and
     would ask that they might be sent to her.&rdquo;&mdash;Lalanne&rsquo;s
     <i>OEuvres de Brantôme</i>, vol. vii. p. 314&mdash;L.

     2  This by the consent of all the commentators is Anne de
     Rohan, elder daughter of John II. Viscount de Rohan, Count
     of Porhoët, Léon and La Garnache, by Mary of Brittany,
     daughter of Duke Francis I. The date of Anne de Rohan&rsquo;s
     birth is not exactly known, but she is said to have been
     about thirty years of age at the time of the tale, though
     the incidents related extend over a somewhat lengthy period.
     However, we know that Anne was ultimately married to Peter
     de Rohan in 1517, when, according to her marriage contract,
     she was over thirty-six years old (<i>Les Preuves de Histoire
     ecclésiastique et civile de Bretagne</i>, 1756, vol. v. col.
     940). From this we may assume that she was thirty in or
     about 1510. The historical incidents alluded to in the tale
     would, however, appear to have occurred (as will be shown by
     subsequent notes) between 1507 and 1509, and we are of
     opinion that the Queen of Navarre has made her heroine
     rather older than she really was, and that the story indeed
     begins in or about 1505, when Rolandine can have been little
     more than five or six and twenty.&mdash;Ed.

     3  See notes to Tale XL. (vol. iv).
</pre>
    <p>
      Thus, owing to her father&rsquo;s neglect and her mistress&rsquo;s disdain, the poor
      maiden continued unmarried for a long while; and this at last made her sad
      at heart, not so much because she longed to be married as because she was
      ashamed at not being so, wherefore she forsook the vanities and pomps of
      the Court and gave herself up wholly to the worship of God. Her sole
      delight consisted in prayer or needlework, and thus in retirement she
      passed her youthful years, living in the most virtuous and holy manner
      imaginable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, when she was approaching her thirtieth year, there was at Court a
      gentleman who was a Bastard of a high and noble house; (4) he was one of
      the pleasantest comrades and most worshipful men of his day, but he was
      wholly without fortune, and possessed of such scant comeliness that no
      lady would have chosen him for her lover.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     4 One cannot absolutely identify this personage; but judging
     by what is said of him in the story&mdash;that he came of a great
     house, that he was very brave but poor, neither rich enough
     to marry Rolandine nor handsome enough to be made a lover
     of, and that a lady, who was a near relative of his, came to
     the Court after his intrigue had been going on for a couple
     of years&mdash;he would certainly appear to be John, Bastard of
     Angoulôme, a natural son of Count John the Good, and
     consequently half-brother to Charles of Angoulôme ( who
     married Louise of Savoy) and uncle to Francis I. and Queen
     Margaret. In Père Anselme&rsquo;s <i>Histoire Généalogique de la
     Maison de France</i>, vol. i. p. 210 B. there is a record of
     the letters of legitimisation granted to the Bastard of
     Angoulême at his father&rsquo;s request in June 1458, and M. Paul
     Lacroix points out that if Rolandine&rsquo;s secret marriage to
     him took place in or about 1508, he would then have been
     about fifty years old, hardly the age for a lover. The
     Bastard is, however, alluded to in the tale as a man of
     mature years, and as at the outset of the intrigue (1505) he
     would have been but forty-seven, we incline with M. de Lincy
     to the belief that he is the hero of it.&mdash;Eu.
</pre>
    <p>
      Thus this poor gentleman had continued unmated, and as one unfortunate
      often seeks out another, he addressed himself to Rolandine, whose fortune,
      temper and condition were like his own. And while they were engaged in
      mutually lamenting their woes, they became very fond of each other, and
      finding that they were companions in misfortune, sought out one another
      everywhere, so that they might exchange consolation, in this wise setting
      on foot a deep and lasting attachment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who had known Rolandine so very retiring that she would speak to
      none, were now greatly shocked on seeing her unceasingly with the
      well-born Bastard, and told her governess that she ought not to suffer
      their long talks together. The governess, therefore, remonstrated with
      Rolandine, and told her that every one was shocked at her conversing so
      freely with a man who was neither rich enough to marry her nor handsome
      enough to be her lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this Rolandine, who had always been rebuked rather for austereness than
      for worldliness, replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, mother, you know that I cannot have a husband of my own condition,
      and that I have always shunned such as are handsome and young, fearing to
      fall into the same difficulties as others. And since this gentleman is
      discreet and virtuous, as you yourself know, and tells me nothing that is
      not honourable and right, what harm can I have done to you and to those
      that have spoken of the matter, by seeking from him some consolation in my
      grief?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The poor old woman, who loved her mistress more than she loved herself,
      replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can see, my lady, that you speak the truth, and know that you are not
      treated by your father and mistress as you deserve to be. Nevertheless,
      since people are speaking about your honour in this way, you ought to
      converse with him no longer, even were he your own brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; said Rolandine, &ldquo;if such be your counsel I will observe it; but
      &lsquo;tis a strange thing to be wholly without consolation in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Bastard came to talk with her according to his wont, but she told him
      everything that her governess had said to her, and, shedding tears,
      besought him to have no converse with her for a while, until the rumour
      should be past and gone; and to this he consented at her request.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being thus cut off from all consolation, they both began, however, to feel
      such torment during their separation as neither had ever known before. For
      her part she did not cease praying to God, journeying and fasting; for
      love, heretofore unknown to her, caused her such exceeding disquiet as not
      to leave her an hour&rsquo;s repose. The well-born Bastard was no better off;
      but, as he had already resolved in his heart to love her and try to wed
      her, and had thought not only of his love but of the honour that it would
      bring him if he succeeded in his design, he reflected that he must devise
      a means of making his love known to her and, above all, of winning the
      governess to his side. This last he did by protesting to her the
      wretchedness of her poor mistress, who was being robbed of all
      consolation. At this the old woman, with many tears, thanked him for the
      honourable affection that he bore her mistress, and they took counsel
      together how he might speak with her. They planned that Rolandine should
      often feign to suffer from headache, to which noise is exceedingly
      distressful; so that, when her companions went into the Queen&rsquo;s apartment,
      she and the Bastard might remain alone, and in this way hold converse
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bastard was overjoyed at this, and, guiding himself wholly by the
      governess&rsquo;s advice, had speech with his sweetheart whensoever he would.
      However, this contentment lasted no great while, for the Queen, who had
      but little love for Rolandine, inquired what she did so constantly in her
      room. Some one replied that it was on account of sickness, but another,
      who possessed too good a memory for the absent, declared that the pleasure
      she took in speaking with the Bastard must needs cause her headache to
      pass away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Queen, who deemed the venial sins of others to be mortal ones in
      Rolandine, sent for her and forbade her ever to speak to the Bastard
      except it were in the royal chamber or hall. The maiden gave no sign, but
      replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had I known, madam, that he or any one beside were displeasing to you, I
      should never have spoken to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless she secretly cast about to find some other plan of which the
      Queen should know nothing, and in this she was successful. On Wednesdays,
      Fridays and Saturdays she was wont to fast, and would then stay with her
      governess in her own room, where, while the others were at supper, she was
      free to speak with the man whom she was beginning to love so dearly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The more they were compelled to shorten their discourse, the more lovingly
      did they talk; for they stole the time even as a robber steals something
      that is of great worth. But, in spite of all their secrecy, a serving-man
      saw the Bastard go into the room one fast day, and reported the matter in
      a quarter where it was not concealed from the Queen. The latter was so
      wroth that the Bastard durst enter the ladies&rsquo; room no more. Yet, that he
      might not lose the delight of converse with his love, he often made a
      pretence of going on a journey, and returned in the evening to the church
      or chapel of the castle (5) dressed as a Grey Friar or a Jacobin, or
      disguised so well in some other way that none could know him; and thither,
      attended by her governess, Rolandine would go to have speech with him.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     5 This would be either the château of Amboise or that of
     Blois, we are inclined to think the latter, as Louis XII.
     more frequently resided there.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      Then, seeing how great was the love she bore him, he feared not to say&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, fair lady, what risk I run in your service, and how the Queen
      has forbidden you to speak with me. You see, further, what manner of man
      is your father, who has no thought whatsoever of bestowing you in
      marriage. He has rejected so many excellent suitors, that I know of none,
      whether near or far, that can win you. I know that I am poor, and that you
      could not wed a gentleman that were not richer than I; yet, if love and
      good-will were counted wealth, I should hold myself for the richest man on
      earth. God has given you great wealth, and you are like to have even more.
      Were I so fortunate as to be chosen for your husband, I would be your
      husband, lover and servant all my life long; whereas, if you take one of
      equal consideration with yourself&mdash;and such a one it were hard to
      find&mdash;he will seek to be the master, and will have more regard for
      your wealth than for your person, and for the beauty of others than for
      your virtue; and, whilst enjoying the use of your wealth, he will fail to
      treat you, yourself, as you deserve. And now my longing to have this
      delight, and my fear that you will have none such with another, impel me
      to pray that you will make me a happy man, and yourself the most contented
      and best treated wife that ever lived.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Rolandine heard the very words that she herself had purposed speaking
      to him, she replied with a glad countenance&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am well pleased that you have been the first to speak such words as I
      had a long while past resolved to say to you. For the two years that I
      have known you I have never ceased to turn over in my mind all the
      arguments for you and against you that I was able to devise; but now that
      I am at last resolved to enter into the married state, it is time that 1
      should make a beginning and choose some one with whom I may look to dwell
      with tranquil mind. And I have been able to find none, whether handsome,
      rich, or nobly born, with whom my heart and soul could agree excepting
      yourself alone. I know that in marrying you I shall not offend God, but
      rather do what He enjoins, while as to his lordship my father, he has
      regarded my welfare so little, and has rejected so many offers, that the
      law suffers me to marry without fear of being disinherited; though, even
      if I had only that which is now mine, I should, in marrying such a husband
      as you, account myself the richest woman in the world. As to the Queen, my
      mistress, I need have no qualms in displeasing her in order to obey God,
      for never had she any in hindering me from any blessing that I might have
      had in my youth. But, to show you that the love I bear you is founded upon
      virtue and honour, you must promise that if I agree to this marriage, you
      will not seek its consummation until my father be dead, or until I have
      found a means to win his consent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this the Bastard readily agreed, whereupon they exchanged rings in
      token of marriage, and kissed each other in the church in the presence of
      God, calling upon Him to witness their promise; and never afterwards was
      there any other familiarity between them save kissing only.
    </p>
    <p>
      This slender delight gave great content to the hearts of these two perfect
      lovers; and, secure in their mutual affection, they lived for some time
      without seeing each other. There was scarcely any place where honour might
      be won to which the Bastard did not go, rejoicing that he could not now
      continue a poor man, seeing that God had bestowed on him a rich wife; and
      she during his absence steadfastly cherished their perfect love, and made
      no account of any other living man. And although there were some who asked
      her in marriage, the only answer they had of her was that, since she had
      remained unwedded for so long a time, she desired to continue so for ever.
      (6)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     6  The speeches of Rolandine and the Bastard should be
     compared with some of Clement Marot&rsquo;s elegies, notably with
     one in which he complains of having been surprised while
     conversing with his mistress in a church.&mdash;B. J.
</pre>

      This reply came to the ears of so many people, that the Queen heard of it
      and asked her why she spoke in that way. Rolandine replied that it was
      done in obedience to herself, who had never been pleased to marry her to
      any man who would have well and comfortably provided for her; accordingly,
      being taught by years and patience to be content with her present
      condition, she would always return a like answer whensoever any one spoke
      to her of marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the wars were over, (7) and the Bastard had returned to Court, she
      never spoke to him in presence of others, but always repaired to some
      church and there had speech with him under pretence of going to
      confession; for the Queen had forbidden them both, under penalty of death,
      to speak together except in public. But virtuous love, which recks naught
      of such a ban, was more ready to find them means of speech than were their
      enemies to spy them out; the Bastard disguised himself in the habit of
      every monkish order he could think of, and thus their virtuous intercourse
      continued, until the King repaired to a pleasure house he had near Tours.

     battle of Aignadel was fought.&mdash;Ed.

     8 This would no doubt be the famous château of Plessis-lez-
     Tours, within a mile of Tours, and long the favourite
     residence of Louis XI. Louis XII. is known to have sojourned
     at Plessis in 1507, at the time when the States-general
     conferred upon him the title of &ldquo;Father of the People.&rdquo;
      English tourists often visit Plessis now adays in memory of
     Scott&rsquo;s &ldquo;Quentin Durward,&rdquo; but only a few shapeless ruins of
     the old structure are left.&mdash;M. and Ed.

      This, however, was not near enough for the ladies to go on foot to any
      other church but that of the castle, which was built in such a fashion
      that it contained no place of concealment in which the confessor would not
      have been plainly recognised.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if one opportunity failed them, love found them another and an easier
      one, for there came to the Court a lady to whom the Bastard was near akin.
      This lady was lodged, together with her son, (9) in the King&rsquo;s abode; and
      the young Prince&rsquo;s room projected from the rest of the King&rsquo;s apartments
      in such a way that from his window it was possible to see and to speak to
      Rolandine, for his window and hers were just at the angle made by the two
      wings of the house.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     9 This lady would be Louise of Savoy. She first came to the
     Court at Amboise in 1499, a circumstance which has led some
     commentators to place the incidents of this story at that
     date. But she was at Blois on various occasions between 1507
     and 1509, to negotiate and attend the marriage of her
     daughter Margaret with the Duke of Alençon. Louis XII.
     having gone from Blois to Plessis in 1507, Louise of Savoy
     may well have followed him thither. Her son was, of course,
     the young Duke de Valois, afterwards Francis I.&mdash;Ed.

    <p>
      In this room of hers, which was over the King&rsquo;s presence-chamber, all the
      noble damsels that were Rolandine&rsquo;s companions were lodged with her. She,
      having many times observed the young Prince at his window, made this known
      to the Bastard through her governess; and he, having made careful
      observation of the place, feigned to take great pleasure in reading a book
      about the Knights of the Round Table (10) which was in the Prince&rsquo;s room.

      And when every one was going to dinner, he would beg a valet to let him
      finish his reading, shut up in the room, over which he promised to keep
      good guard. The servants knew him to be a kinsman of his master and one to
      be trusted, let him read as much as he would. Rolandine, on her part,
      would then come to her window; and, so that she might be able to make a
      long stay at it, she pretended to have an infirmity in the leg, and
      accordingly dined and supped so early that she no longer frequented the
      ladies&rsquo; table. She likewise set herself to work a coverlet of crimson
      silk, (11) and fastened it at the window, where she desired to be alone;
      and, when she saw that none was by, she would converse with her husband,
      who contrived to speak in such a voice as could not be overheard; and
      whenever any one was coming, she would cough and make a sign, so that the
      Bastard might withdraw in good time.

      Those who kept watch upon them felt sure that their love was past, for she
      never stirred from the room in which, as they thought, he could assuredly
      never see her, since it was forbidden him to enter it.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, however, the young Prince&rsquo;s mother, (12) being in her son&rsquo;s room,
      placed herself at the window where this big book lay, and had not long
      been there when one of Rolandine&rsquo;s companions, who was at the window in
      the opposite room, greeted her and spoke to her. The lady asked her how
      Rolandine did; whereon the other replied that she might see her if she
      would, and brought her to the window in her nightcap. Then, when they had
      spoken together about her sickness, they withdrew from the window on
      either side.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     12  Louise of Savoy.
</pre>
    <p>
      The lady, observing the big book about the Round Table, said to the
      servant who had it in his keeping&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am surprised that young folk can waste their time in reading such
      foolishness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The servant replied that he marvelled even more that people accounted
      sensible and of mature age should have a still greater liking for it than
      the young; and he told her, as matter for wonderment, how her cousin the
      Bastard would spend four or five hours each day in reading this fine book.
      Straightway there came into the lady&rsquo;s mind the reason why he acted thus,
      and she charged the servant to hide himself somewhere, and take account of
      what the Bastard might do. This the man did, and found that the Bastard&rsquo;s
      book was the window to which Rolandine came to speak with him, and he,
      moreover, heard many a love-speech which they had thought to keep wholly
      secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morrow he related this to his mistress, who sent for the Bastard,
      and after chiding him forbade him to return to that place again; and in
      the evening she spoke of the matter to Rolandine, and threatened, if she
      persisted in this foolish love, to make all these practices known to the
      Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rolandine, whom nothing could dismay, vowed that in spite of all that
      folks might say she had never spoken to him since her mistress had
      forbidden her to do so, as might be learned both from her companions and
      from her servants and attendants. And as for the window, she declared that
      she had never spoken at it to the Bastard. He, however, fearing that the
      matter had been discovered, withdrew out of harm&rsquo;s way, and was a long
      time without returning to Court, though not without writing to Rolandine,
      and this in so cunning a manner that, in spite of the Queen&rsquo;s vigilance,
      never a week went by but she twice heard from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he no longer found it possible to employ monks as messengers, as he
      had done at first, he would send a little page, dressed now in one colour
      and now in another; and the page used to stand at the doorways through
      which the ladies were wont to pass, and deliver his letters secretly in
      the throng. But one day, when the Queen was going out into the country, it
      chanced that one who was charged to look after this matter recognised the
      page, and hastened after him; but he, being keen-witted and suspecting
      that he was being pursued, entered the house of a poor woman who was
      boiling her pot on the fire, and there forthwith burned his letters. The
      gentleman who followed him stripped him naked and searched through all his
      clothes; but he could find nothing, and so let him go. And the boy being
      gone, the old woman asked the gentleman why he had so searched him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To find some letters,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;which I thought he had upon him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could by no means have found them,&rdquo; said the old woman, &ldquo;they were
      too well hidden for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pray you,&rdquo; said the gentleman, in the hope of getting them before long,
      &ldquo;tell me where they were.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      However, when he heard that they had been thrown into the fire, he
      perceived that the page had proved more crafty than himself, and forthwith
      made report of the matter to the Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that time, however, the Bastard no longer employed the page or any
      other child, but sent an old servant of his, who, laying aside all fear of
      the death which, as he well knew, was threatened by the Queen against all
      such as should interfere in this matter, undertook to carry his master&rsquo;s
      letters to Rolandine. And having come to the castle where she was, he
      posted himself on the watch at the foot of a broad staircase, beside a
      doorway through which all the ladies were wont to pass. But a serving-man,
      who had aforetime seen him, knew him again immediately and reported the
      matter to the Queen&rsquo;s Master of the Household, who quickly came to arrest
      him. However, the discreet and wary servant, seeing that he was being
      watched from a distance, turned towards the wall as though he desired to
      make water, and tearing the letter he had into the smallest possible
      pieces, threw them behind a door. Immediately afterwards he was taken and
      thoroughly searched, and nothing being found on him, they asked him on his
      oath whether he had not brought letters, using all manner of threats and
      persuasions to make him confess the truth; but neither by promises nor
      threats could they draw anything from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Report of this having been made to the Queen, some one in the company
      bethought him that it would be well to look behind the door near which the
      man had been taken. This was done, and they found what they sought, namely
      the pieces of the letter. Then the King&rsquo;s confessor was sent for, and he,
      having put the pieces together on a table, read the whole of the letter,
      in which the truth of the marriage, that had been so carefully concealed,
      was made manifest; for the Bastard called Rolandine nothing but &ldquo;wife.&rdquo;
       The Queen, who was in no mind, as she should have been, to hide her
      neighbour&rsquo;s transgressions, made a great ado about the matter, and
      commanded that all means should be employed to make the poor man confess
      the truth of the letter. And indeed, when they showed it to him, he could
      not deny it; but for all they could say or show, he would say no more than
      at first. Those who had him in charge thereupon brought him to the brink
      of the river, and put him into a sack, declaring that he had lied to God
      and to the Queen, contrary to proven truth. But he was minded to die
      rather than accuse his master, and asked for a confessor; and when he had
      eased his conscience as well as might be, he said to them&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good sirs, I pray you tell the Bastard, my master, that I commend the
      lives of my wife and children to him, for right willingly do I yield up my
      own in his service. You may do with me what you will, for never shall you
      draw from me a word against my master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon, all the more to affright him, they threw him in the sack into
      the water, calling to him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will tell the truth, you shall be saved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Finding, however, that he answered nothing, they drew him out again, and
      made report of his constancy to the Queen, who on hearing of it declared
      that neither the King nor herself were so fortunate in their followers as
      was this gentleman the Bastard, though he lacked even the means to requite
      them. She then did all that she could to draw the servant into her own
      service, but he would by no means consent to forsake his master. However,
      by the latter&rsquo;s leave, he at last entered the Queen&rsquo;s service, in which he
      lived in happiness and contentment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Queen, having learnt the truth of the marriage from the Bastard&rsquo;s
      letter, sent for Rolandine, whom with a wrathful countenance she several
      times called &ldquo;wretch&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;cousin,&rdquo; reproaching her with the shame
      that she had brought both upon her father&rsquo;s house and her mistress by thus
      marrying without her leave or commandment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rolandine, who had long known what little love her mistress bore her, gave
      her but little in return. Moreover, since there was no love between them,
      neither was there fear; and as Rolandine perceived that this reprimand,
      given her in presence of several persons, was prompted less by affection
      than by a desire to put her to shame, and that the Queen felt more
      pleasure in chiding her than grief at finding her in fault, she replied
      with a countenance as glad and tranquil as the Queen&rsquo;s was disturbed and
      wrathful&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If, madam, you did not know your own heart, such as it is, I would set
      forth to you the ill-will that you have long borne my father (13) and
      myself; but you do, indeed, know this, and will not deem it strange that
      all the world should have an inkling of it too. For my own part, madam, I
      have perceived it to my dear cost, for had you been pleased to favour me
      equally as you favour those who are not so near to you as myself, I were
      now married to your honour as well as to my own; but you passed me over as
      one wholly a stranger to your favour, and so all the good matches I might
      have made passed away before my eyes, through my father&rsquo;s neglect and the
      slenderness of your regard. By reason of this treatment I fell into such
      deep despair, that, had my health been strong enough in any sort to endure
      a nun&rsquo;s condition, I would have willingly entered upon it to escape from
      the continual griefs your harshness brought me.

     13  Of all those with pretensions to the Duchy of Brittany,
     the Viscount de Rohan had doubtless the best claim, though
     he met with the least satisfaction. It was, however, this
     reason that led the Queen [Anne of Brittany] to treat him
     with such little regard. It was with mingled grief and
     resentment that this proud princess realised how real were
     the Viscount&rsquo;s rights; moreover, she never forgave him for
     having taken up arms against her in favour of France; and
     seeking an opportunity to avenge herself, she found one in
     giving the Viscount but little satisfaction in the matter of
     his pretensions.&rdquo;&mdash;Dora Morice&rsquo;s <i>Histoire ecclésiastique et
     civile de Bretagne</i>, Paris, 1756, vol. ii. p. 231.&mdash;L.

    <p>
      &ldquo;Whilst in this despair I was sought by one whose lineage would be as good
      as my own if mutual love were rated as high as a marriage ring; for you
      know that his father would walk before mine. He has long wooed and loved
      me; but you, madam, who have never forgiven me the smallest fault nor
      praised me for any good deed, you&mdash;although you knew from experience
      that I was not wont to speak of love or worldly things, and that I led a
      more retired and religious life than any other of your maids&mdash;forthwith
      deemed it strange that I should speak with a gentleman who is as
      unfortunate in this life as I am myself, and one, moreover, in whose
      friendship I thought and looked to have nothing save comfort to my soul.
      When I found myself wholly baffled in this design, I fell into great
      despair, and resolved to seek my peace as earnestly as you longed to rob
      me of it; whereupon we exchanged words of marriage, and confirmed them
      with promise and ring. Wherefore, madam, methinks you do me a grievous
      wrong in calling me wicked, seeing that in this great and perfect love,
      wherein opportunity, had I so desired, would not have been lacking, no
      greater familiarity has passed between us than a kiss. I have waited in
      the hope that, before the consummation of the marriage, I might by the
      grace of God win my father&rsquo;s heart to consent to it. I have given no
      offence to God or to my conscience, for I have waited till the age of
      thirty to see what you and my father would do for me, and have kept my
      youth in such chastity and virtue that no living man can bring up aught
      against me. But when I found that I was old and without hope of being
      wedded suitably to my birth and condition, I used the reason that God has
      given me, and resolved to marry a gentleman after my own heart. And this I
      did not to gratify the lust of the eye, for you know that he is not
      handsome; nor the lust of the flesh, for there has been no carnal
      consummation of our marriage; nor the ambition and pride of life, for he
      is poor and of small rank; but I took account purely and simply of the
      worth that is in him, for which every one is constrained to praise him,
      and also of the great love that he bears me, and that gives me hope of
      having a life of quietness and kindness with him. Having carefully weighed
      all the good and the evil that may come of it, I have done what seems to
      me best, and, after considering the matter in my heart for two years, I am
      resolved to pass the remainder of my days with him. And so firm is my
      resolve that no torment that may be inflicted upon me, nor even death
      itself, shall ever cause me to depart from it. Wherefore, madam, I pray
      you excuse that which is indeed very excusable, as you yourself must
      realise, and suffer me to dwell in that peace which I hope to find with
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Queen, finding her so steadfast of countenance and so true of speech,
      could make no reply in reason, but continued wrathfully rebuking and
      reviling her, bursting into tears and saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wretch that you are! instead of humbling yourself before me, and
      repenting of so grievous a fault, you speak hardily with never a tear in
      your eye, and thus clearly show the obstinacy and hardness of your heart.
      But if the King and your father give heed to me, they will put you into a
      place where you will be compelled to speak after a different fashion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; replied Rolandine, &ldquo;since you charge me with speaking too
      hardily, I will e&rsquo;en be silent if you give me not permission to reply to
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, being commanded to speak, she went on&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis not for me, madam, to speak to you, my mistress and the greatest
      Princess in Christendom, hardily and without the reverence that I owe to
      you, nor have I purposed doing so; but I have no defender to speak for me
      except the truth, and as this is known to me alone, I am forced to utter
      it fearlessly in the hope that, when you know it, you will not hold me for
      such as you have been pleased to name me. I fear not that any living being
      should learn how I have comported myself in the matter that is laid to my
      charge, for I know that I have offended neither against God nor against my
      honour. And this it is that enables me to speak without fear; for I feel
      sure that He who sees my heart is on my side, and with such a Judge in my
      favour, I were wrong to fear such as are subject to His decision. Why
      should I weep? My conscience and my heart do not at all rebuke me, and so
      far am I from repenting of this matter, that, were it to be done over
      again, I should do just the same. But you, madam, have good cause to weep
      both for the deep wrong that you have done me throughout my youth, and for
      that which you are now doing me, in rebuking me publicly for a fault that
      should be laid at your door rather than at mine. Had I offended God, the
      King, yourself, my kinsfolk or my conscience, I were indeed obstinate and
      perverse if I did not greatly repent with tears; but I may not weep for
      that which is excellent, just and holy, and which would have received only
      commendation had you not made it known before the proper time. In doing
      this, you have shown that you had a greater desire to compass my dishonour
      than to preserve the honour of your house and kin. But, since such is your
      pleasure, madam, I have nothing to say against it; command me what
      suffering you will, and I, innocent though I am, will be as glad to endure
      as you to inflict it. Wherefore, madam, you may charge my father to
      inflict whatsoever torment you would have me undergo, for I well know that
      he will not fail to obey you. It is pleasant to know that, to work me ill,
      he will wholly fall in with your desire, and that as he has neglected my
      welfare in submission to your will, so will he be quick to obey you to my
      hurt. But I have a Father in Heaven, and He will, I am sure, give me
      patience equal to all the evils that I foresee you preparing for me, and
      in Him alone do I put my perfect trust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Queen, beside herself with wrath, commanded that Rolandine should be
      taken from her sight and put into a room alone, where she might have
      speech with no one. However, her governess was not taken from her, and
      through her Rolandine acquainted the Bastard with all that had befallen
      her, and asked him what he would have her do. He, thinking that his
      services to the King might avail him something, came with all speed to the
      Court. Finding the King at the chase, he told him the whole truth,
      entreating him to favour a poor gentleman so far as to appease the Queen
      and bring about the consummation of the marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King made no reply except to ask&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you assure me that you have wedded her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire,&rdquo; said the Bastard, &ldquo;but by word of mouth alone; however, if it
      please you, we&rsquo;ll make an ending of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The King bent his head, and, without saying anything more, returned
      straight towards the castle, and when he was nigh to it summoned the
      Captain of his Guard, and charged him to take the Bastard prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, a friend who knew and could interpret the King&rsquo;s visage, warned
      the Bastard to withdraw and betake himself to a house of his that was hard
      by, saying that if the King, as he expected, sought for him, he should
      know of it forthwith, so that he might fly the kingdom; whilst if, on the
      other hand, things became smoother, he should have word to return. The
      Bastard followed this counsel, and made such speed that the Captain of the
      Guards was not able to find him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King and Queen took counsel together as to what they should do with
      the hapless lady who had the honour of being related to them, and by the
      Queen&rsquo;s advice it was decided that she should be sent back to her father,
      and that he should be made acquainted with the whole truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      But before sending her away they caused many priests and councillors to
      speak with her and show her that, since her marriage consisted in words
      only, it might by mutual agreement readily be made void; and this, they
      urged, the King desired her to do in order to maintain the honour of the
      house to which she belonged.
    </p>
    <p>
      She made answer that she was ready to obey the King in all such things as
      were not contrary to her conscience, but that those whom God had brought
      together man could not put asunder. She therefore begged them not to tempt
      her to anything so unreasonable; for if love and goodwill founded on the
      fear of God were the true and certain marriage ties, she was Clinked by
      bonds that neither steel nor flame nor water could sever. Death alone
      might do this, and to death alone would she resign her ring and her oath.
      She therefore prayed them to gainsay her no more; for so strong of purpose
      was she that she would rather keep faith and die than break it and live.
    </p>
    <p>
      This steadfast reply was repeated to the King by those whom he had
      appointed to speak with her, and when it was found that she could by no
      means be brought to renounce her husband, she was sent to her father, and
      this in so pitiful a plight that all who beheld her pass wept to see her.
      And although she had done wrong, her punishment was so grievous and her
      constancy so great, that her wrongdoing was made to appear a virtue.
    </p>
    <p>
      When her father heard the pitiful tale, he would not see her, but sent her
      away to a castle in a forest, which he had aforetime built for a reason
      well worthy to be related. (14) There he kept her in prison for a long
      time, causing her to be told that if she would give up her husband he
      would treat her as his daughter and set her free.
    </p>

     Tale XL., vol. lv.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      Nevertheless she continued firm, for she preferred the bonds of prison
      together with those of marriage, to all the freedom in the world without
      her husband. And, judging from her countenance, all her woes seemed but
      pleasant pastimes to her, since she was enduring them for one she loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, what shall I say of men? The Bastard, who was so deeply beholden
      to her, as you have seen, fled to Germany where he had many friends, and
      there showed by his fickleness that he had sought Rolandine less from true
      and perfect love than from avarice and ambition; for he fell deeply in
      love with a German lady, and forgot to write to the woman who for his sake
      was enduring so much tribulation. However cruel Fortune might be towards
      them, they were always able to write to each other, until he conceived
      this foolish and wicked love. And Rolandine&rsquo;s heart gaining an inkling of
      it, she could no longer rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      And afterwards, when she found that his letters were colder and different
      from what they had been before, she suspected that some new love was
      separating her from her husband, and doing that which all the torments and
      afflictions laid upon herself had been unable to effect. Nevertheless, her
      perfect love would not pass judgment on mere suspicion, so she found a
      means of secretly sending a trusty servant, not to carry letters or
      messages to him, but to watch him and discover the truth. When this
      servant had returned from his journey, he told her that the Bastard was
      indeed deeply in love with a German lady, and that according to common
      report he was seeking to marry her, for she was very rich.
    </p>
    <p>
      These tidings brought extreme and unendurable grief to Rolandine&rsquo;s heart,
      so that she fell grievously sick. Those who knew the cause of her
      sickness, told her on behalf of her father that, with this great
      wickedness on the part of the Bastard before her eyes, she might now
      justly renounce him. They did all they could to persuade her to that
      intent, but, notwithstanding her exceeding anguish, she could not be
      brought to change her purpose, and in this last temptation again gave
      proof of her great love and surpassing virtue. For as love grew less and
      less on his part, so did it grow greater on hers, and in this way make
      good that which was lost. And when she knew that the entire and perfect
      love that once had been shared by both remained but in her heart alone,
      she resolved to preserve it there until one or the other of them should
      die. And the Divine Goodness, which is perfect charity and true love, took
      pity upon her grief and long suffering, in such wise that a few days
      afterwards the Bastard died while occupied in seeking after another woman.
      Being advised of this by certain persons who had seen him laid in the
      ground, she sent to her father and begged that he would be pleased to
      speak with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father, who had never spoken to her since her imprisonment, came
      without delay. He listened to all the pleas that she had to urge, and
      then, instead of rebuking her or killing her as he had often threatened,
      he took her in his arms and wept exceedingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My daughter,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are more in the right than I, for if there
      has been any wrongdoing in this matter, I have been its principal cause.
      But now, since God has so ordered it, I would gladly atone for the past.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took her home and treated her as his eldest daughter. A gentleman who
      bore the same name and arms as did her own family sought her in marriage;
      he was very sensible and virtuous, (15) and he thought so much of
      Rolandine, whom he often visited, that he gave praise to what others
      blamed in her, perceiving that virtue had been her only aim. The marriage,
      being acceptable both to Rolandine and to her father, was concluded
      without delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is true, however, that a brother she had, the sole heir of their house,
      would not grant her a portion, for he charged her with having disobeyed
      her father. And after his father&rsquo;s death he treated her so harshly that
      she and her husband (who was a younger son) had much ado to live. (16)

     Peter de Rohan, Lord of Gié, Marshal of Prance and preceptor

     in 1517, and eight years later the husband was killed at
     Pavia.&mdash;Ed.

     16  Anne de Rohan (Rolandine) had two brothers, James and
     Claud. Both died without issue. Some particulars concerning
     them will be found in the notes to Tale XL. The father&rsquo;s
     death, according to Anselme, took place in 1516, that is,
     prior to Anne&rsquo;s marriage.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      However, God provided for them, for the brother that sought to keep
      everything died suddenly one day, leaving behind him both her wealth,
      which he was keeping back, and his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus did she inherit a large and rich estate, whereon she lived piously
      and virtuously and in her husband&rsquo;s love. And after she had brought up the
      two sons that God gave to them, (17) she yielded with gladness her soul to
      Him in whom she had at all times put her perfect trust.

     17 Anne&rsquo;s sons were René and Claud. Miss Mary Robinson (<i>The
     Fortunate Lovers</i>, London, 1887) believes René to be
     &ldquo;Saffredent,&rdquo; and his wife Isabel d&rsquo;Albret, sister of Queen
     Margaret&rsquo;s husband Henry of Navarre, to be &ldquo;Nomerfide.&rdquo;&mdash;Ed.

    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, ladies, let the men who would make us out so fickle come forward and
      point to an instance of as good a husband as this lady was a good wife,
      and of one having like faith and steadfastness. I am sure they would find
      it so difficult to do this, that I will release them from the task rather
      than put them to such exceeding toil. But as for you, ladies, I would pray
      you, for the sake of maintaining your own fair fame, either to love not at
      all, or else to love as perfectly as she did. And let none among you say
      that this lady offended against her honour, seeing that her constancy has
      served to heighten our own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In good sooth, Parlamente,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;you have indeed told us the
      story of a woman possessed of a noble and honourable heart; but her
      constancy derives half its lustre from the faithlessness of a husband that
      could leave her for another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Longarine, &ldquo;that the grief so caused must have been the
      hardest to bear. There is none so heavy that the love of two united lovers
      cannot support it; but when one fails in his duty, and leaves the whole of
      the burden to the other, the load becomes too heavy to be endured.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you ought to pity us,&rdquo; said Geburon, &ldquo;for we have to bear the whole
      burden of love, and you will not put out the tip of a finger to relieve
      us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Geburon,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;the burdens of men and of women are often
      different enough. The love of a woman, being founded on godliness and
      honour, is just and reasonable, and any man that is false to it must be
      reckoned a coward, and a sinner against God and man. On the other hand,
      most men love only with reference to pleasure, and women, being ignorant
      of their ill intent, are sometimes ensnared; but when God shows them how
      vile is the heart of the man whom they deemed good, they may well draw
      back to save their honour and reputation, for soonest ended is best
      mended.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, that is a whimsical idea of yours,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;to hold that an
      honourable woman may in all honour betray the love of a man; but that a
      man may not do as much towards a woman. You would make out that the heart
      of the one differs from that of the other; but for my part, in spite of
      their differences in countenance and dress, I hold them to be alike in
      inclination, except indeed that the guilt which is best concealed is the
      worst.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereto Parlamente replied with some heat&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am well aware that in your opinion the best women are those whose guilt
      is known.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us leave this discourse,&rdquo; said Simontault; &ldquo;for whether we take the
      heart of man or the heart of woman, the better of the twain is worth
      nothing. And now let us see to whom Parlamente is going to give her vote,
      so that we may hear some fine tale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I give it,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to Geburon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since I began,&rdquo; (18) he replied, &ldquo;by talking about the Grey friars, I
      must not forget those of Saint Benedict, nor an adventure in which they
      were concerned in my own time. Nevertheless, in telling you the story of a
      wicked monk, I do not wish to hinder you from having a good opinion of
      such as are virtuous; but since the Psalmist says &lsquo;all men are liars,&rsquo; and
      in another place, &lsquo;there is none that doeth good, no not one,&rsquo; (19) I
      think we are bound to look upon men as they really are. If there be any
      virtue in them, we must attribute it to Him who is its source, and not to
      the creature. Most people deceive themselves by giving overmuch praise or
      glory to the latter, or by thinking that there is something good in
      themselves. That you may not deem it impossible for exceeding lust to
      exist under exceeding austerity, listen to what befel in the days of King
      Francis the First.&rdquo;

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>Sister Marie Heroet, being unchastely solicited by a Prior
     of Saint-Martin-in-the-Fields, was by the grace of God
     enabled to overcome his great temptations, to the Prior&rsquo;s
     exceeding confusion and her own glory</i>. (1)

     1  This story is historical, and though M. Frank indicates
     points of similarity between it and No. xxvii. of St. Denis&rsquo;
     <i>Comptes du Monde Adventureux</i>, and No. vi. of Masuccio de
     Solerac&rsquo;s <i>Novellino</i>, these are of little account when one
     remembers that the works in question were written posterior
     to the <i>Heptameron</i>. The incidents related in the tale must
     have occurred between 1530 and 1535. The Abbey of Saint-
     Martin-in-the-Fields stood on the site of the present
     Conservatoire des Arts et Métiers, Paris.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      In the city of Paris there was a Prior of Saint-Martin-in-the-Fields,
      whose name I will keep secret for the sake of the friendship I bore him.
      Until he reached the age of fifty years, his life was so austere that the
      fame of his holiness was spread throughout the entire kingdom, and there
      was not a prince or princess but showed him high honour when he came to
      visit them. There was further no monkish reform that was not wrought by
      his hand, so that people called him the &ldquo;father of true monasticism.&rdquo; (2)
    </p>
    <p>
      He was chosen visitor to the illustrious order of the &ldquo;Ladies of
      Fontevrault,&rdquo; (3) by whom he was held in such awe that, when he visited
      any of their convents, the nuns shook with very fear, and to soften his
      harshness towards them would treat him as though he had been the King
      himself in person. At first he would not have them do this, but at last,
      when he was nearly fifty-five years old, he began to find the treatment he
      had formerly contemned very pleasant; and reckoning himself the mainstay
      of all monasticism, he gave more care to the preservation of his health
      than had heretofore been his wont. Although the rules of his order forbade
      him ever to partake of flesh, he granted himself a dispensation (which was
      more than he ever did for another), declaring that the whole burden of
      conventual affairs rested upon him; for which reason he feasted himself so
      well that, from being a very lean monk he became a very fat one.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     2 This prior was Stephen Gentil, who succeeded Philip
     Bourgoin on December 15, 1508, and died November 6, 1536.
     The <i>Gallia Christiana</i> states that in 1524 he reformed an
     abbey of the diocese of Soissons, but makes no mention of
     his appointment as visitor to the abbey of Fontevrault.
     Various particulars concerning him will be found in Manor&rsquo;s
     <i>Monasterii Regalis S. Martini de Campis, &amp;c. Parisiis</i>,
     1636, and in <i>Gallia Christiana</i>, vol. vii. col. 539.&mdash;L.

     3 The abbey of Fontevrault, near Saumur, Maine-et-Loire, was
     founded in 1100 by Robert d&rsquo;Arbrissel, and comprised two
     conventual establishments, one for men and the other for
     women. Prior to his death, d&rsquo;Arbrissel abdicated his
     authority in favour of Petronilla de Chemillé, and from her
     time forward monks and nuns alike were always under the sway
     of an abbess&mdash;this being the only instance of the kind in
     the history of the Roman Catholic Church. Fourteen of the
     abbesses were princesses, and several of these were of the
     blood royal of France. In the abbey church were buried our
     Henry II., Eleanor of Guienne, Richard Coeur-de-Lion, and
     Isabella of Angoulême; their tombs are still shown, though
     the abbey has become a prison, and its church a refectory.&mdash;
     Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      Together with this change of life there was wrought also a great change of
      heart, so that he now began to cast glances upon countenances which
      aforetime he had looked at only as a duty; and, contemplating charms which
      were rendered even more desirable by the veil, he began to hanker after
      them. Then, to satisfy this longing, he sought out such cunning devices
      that at last from being a shepherd he became a wolf, so that in many a
      convent, where there chanced to be a simple maiden, he failed not to
      beguile her. But after he had continued this evil life for a long time,
      the Divine Goodness took compassion upon the poor, wandering sheep, and
      would no longer suffer this villain&rsquo;s triumph to endure, as you shall
      hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day he went to visit the convent of Gif, (4) not far from Paris, and
      while he was confessing all the nuns, it happened that there was one among
      them called Marie Heroet, whose speech was so gentle and pleasing that it
      gave promise of a countenance and heart to match.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     4  Gif, an abbey of the Benedictine order, was situated at
     five leagues from Paris, in the valley of Chevreuse, on the
     bank of the little river Yvette. A few ruins of it still
     remain. It appears to have been founded in the eleventh
     century.&mdash;See Le Beuf s <i>Histoire du Diocèse de Paris</i>, vol.
     viii. part viii. p. 106, and <i>Gallia Christiana</i>, vol. vii.
     col. 596.&mdash;L. and D.
</pre>
    <p>
      The mere sound of her voice moved him with a passion exceeding any that he
      had ever felt for other nuns, and, while speaking to her, he bent low to
      look at her, and perceiving her rosy, winsome mouth, could not refrain
      from lifting her veil to see whether her eyes were in keeping therewith.
      He found that they were, and his heart was filled with so ardent a passion
      that, although he sought to conceal it, his countenance became changed,
      and he could no longer eat or drink. When he returned to his priory, he
      could find no rest, but passed his days and nights in deep disquiet,
      seeking to devise a means whereby he might accomplish his desire, and make
      of this nun what he had already made of many others. But this, he feared,
      would be difficult, seeing that he had found her to be prudent of speech
      and shrewd of understanding; moreover, he knew himself to be old and ugly,
      and therefore resolved not to employ words but to seek to win her by fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, not long afterwards, he returned to the convent of Gif
      aforesaid, where he showed more austerity than he had ever done before,
      and spoke wrathfully to all the nuns, telling one that her veil was not
      low enough, another that she carried her head too high, and another that
      she did not do him reverence as a nun should do. So harsh was he in
      respect of all these trifles, that they feared him as though he had been a
      god sitting on the throne of judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being gouty, he grew very weary in visiting all the usual parts of the
      convent, and it thus came to pass that about the hour for vespers, an hour
      which he had himself fixed upon, he found himself in the dormitory, when
      the Abbess said to him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reverend father, it is time to go to vespers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go, mother,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;do you go to vespers. I am so weary that I will
      remain here, yet not to rest but to speak to Sister Marie, of whom I have
      had a very bad report, for I am told that she prates like a worldly-minded
      woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Abbess, who was aunt to the maiden&rsquo;s mother, begged him to reprove her
      soundly, and left her alone with him and a young monk who accompanied him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he found himself alone with Sister Marie, he began to lift up her
      veil, and to tell her to look at him. She answered that the rule of her
      order forbade her to look at men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is well said, my daughter,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;but you must not consider us
      monks as men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Sister Marie, fearing to sin by disobedience, looked him in the face;
      but he was so ugly that she though it rather a penance than a sin to look
      at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good father, after telling her at length of his goodwill towards her,
      sought to lay his hand upon her breasts; but she repulsed him, as was her
      duty; whereupon, in great wrath, he said to her&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Should a nun know that she has breasts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that I have,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;and certes neither you nor any other
      shall ever touch them. I am not so young and ignorant that I do not know
      the difference between what is sin and what is not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he saw that such talk would not prevail upon her, he adopted a
      different plan, and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, my daughter, I must make known to you my extreme need. I have an
      infirmity which all the physicians hold to be incurable unless I have
      pleasure with some woman whom I greatly love. For my part, I would rather
      die than commit a mortal sin; but, when it comes to that, I know that
      simple fornication is in no wise to be compared with the sin of homicide.
      So, if you love my life, you will preserve it for me, as well as your own
      conscience from cruelty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She asked him what manner of pleasure he desired to have. He replied that
      she might safely surrender her conscience to his own, and that he would do
      nothing that could be a burden to either.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, to let her see the beginning of the pastime that he sought, he took
      her in his arms and tried to throw her upon a bed. She, recognising his
      evil purpose, defended herself so well with arms and voice that he could
      only touch her garments. Then, when he saw that all his devices and
      efforts were being brought to naught, he behaved like a madman and one
      devoid not only of conscience but of natural reason, for, thrusting his
      hand under her dress, he scratched wherever his nails could reach with
      such fury that the poor girl shrieked out, and fell swooning at full
      length upon the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hearing this cry, the Abbess came into the dormitory; for while at vespers
      she had remembered that she had left her niece&rsquo;s daughter alone with the
      good father, and feeling some scruples of conscience, she had left the
      chapel and repaired to the door of the dormitory in order to learn what
      was going on. On hearing her niece&rsquo;s voice, she pushed open the door,
      which was being held by the young monk.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when the Prior saw the Abbess coming, he pointed to her niece as she
      lay in a swoon, and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Assuredly, mother, you are greatly to blame that you did not inform me of
      Sister Marie&rsquo;s condition. Knowing nothing of her weakness, I caused her to
      stand before me, and, while I was reproving her, she swooned away as you
      see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They revived her with vinegar and other remedies, and found that she had
      wounded her head in her fall. When she was recovered, the Prior, fearing
      that she would tell her aunt the reason of her indisposition, took her
      aside and said to her&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I charge you, my daughter, if you would be obedient and hope for
      salvation, never to speak of what I said to you just now. You must know
      that it was my exceeding love for you that constrained me, but since I see
      that you do not wish to love me, I will never speak of it to you again.
      However, if you be willing, I promise to have you chosen Abbess of one of
      the three best convents in the kingdom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She replied that she would rather die in perpetual imprisonment than have
      any lover save Him who had died for her on the cross, for she would rather
      suffer with Him all the evils the world could inflict than possess without
      Him all its blessings. And she added that he must never again speak to her
      in such a manner, or she would inform the Abbess; whereas, if he kept
      silence, so would she.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon this evil shepherd left her, and in order to make himself appear
      quite other than he was, and to again have the pleasure of looking upon
      her he loved, he turned to the Abbess and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg, mother, that you will cause all your nuns to sing a <i>Salve
      Regina</i> in honour of that virgin in whom I rest my hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While this was being done, the old fox did nothing but shed tears, not of
      devotion, but of grief at his lack of success. All the nuns, thinking that
      it was for love of the Virgin Mary, held him for a holy man, but Sister
      Marie, who knew his wickedness, prayed in her heart that one having so
      little reverence for virginity might be brought to confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so this hypocrite departed to St. Martin&rsquo;s, where the evil fire that
      was in his heart did not cease burning night and day alike, prompting him
      to all manner of devices in order to compass his ends. As he above all
      things feared the Abbess, who was a virtuous woman, he hit upon a plan to
      withdraw her from the convent, and betook himself to Madame de Vendôme,
      who was at that time living at La Fère, where she had founded and built a
      convent of the Benedictine order called Mount Olivet. (5)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     5  This is Mary of Luxemburg, Countess of St. Paul-de-
     Conversan, Marie and Soissons, who married, first, James of
     Savoy, and secondly, Francis de Bourbon, Count of Vendôme.
     The latter, who accompanied Charles VIII. to Italy, was
     killed at Vercelli in October 1495, when but twenty-five
     years old. His widow did not marry again, but retired to her
     château of La Fère near Laon (Aisne), where late in 1518 she
     founded a convent of Benedictine nuns, which, according to
     the <i>Gallia Christiana</i>, she called the convent of Mount
     Calvary. This must be the establishment alluded to by Queen
     Margaret, who by mistake has called it Mount Olivet, i.e.,
     the Mount of Olives. Madame de Vendôme died at a very
     advanced age on April 1, 1546.&mdash;See Anselme&rsquo;s <i>Histoire
     Généalogique</i>, vol. i. p. 326.&mdash;L.
</pre>
    <p>
      Speaking in the quality of a prince of reformers, he gave her to
      understand that the Abbess of the aforesaid Mount Olivet lacked the
      capacity to govern such a community. The worthy lady begged him to give
      her another that should be worthy of the office, and he, who asked nothing
      better, counselled her to have the Abbess of Gif, as being the most
      capable in France. Madame de Vendôme sent for her forthwith, and set her
      over the convent of Mount Olivet.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the Prior of St. Martin&rsquo;s had every monastic vote at his disposal, he
      caused one who was devoted to him to be chosen Abbess of Gif, and this
      being accomplished, he went to Gif to try once more whether he might win
      Sister Marie Heroet by prayers or honied words. Finding that he could not
      succeed, he returned in despair to his priory of St. Martin&rsquo;s, and in
      order to achieve his purpose, to revenge himself on her who was so cruel
      to him, and further to prevent the affair from becoming known, he caused
      the relics of the aforesaid convent of Gif to be secretly stolen at night,
      and accusing the confessor of the convent, a virtuous and very aged man,
      of having stolen them, he cast him into prison at St. Martin&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst he held him captive there, he stirred up two witnesses who in
      ignorance signed what the Prior commanded them, which was a statement that
      they had seen the confessor in a garden with Sister Marie, engaged in a
      foul and wicked act; and this the Prior sought to make the old monk
      confess. But he, who knew all the Prior&rsquo;s misdoings, entreated him to
      bring him before the Chapter, saying that there, in presence of all the
      monks, he would tell the truth of all that he knew. The Prior, fearing
      that the confessor&rsquo;s justification would be his own condemnation, would in
      no wise grant this request; and, finding him firm of purpose, he treated
      him so ill in prison that some say he brought about his death, and others
      that he forced him to lay aside his robe and betake himself out of the
      kingdom of France. Be that as it may, the confessor was never seen again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prior, thinking that he had now a sure hold upon Sister Marie,
      repaired to the convent, where the Abbess, chosen for this purpose,
      gainsaid him in nothing. There he began to exercise his authority as
      visitor, and caused all the nuns to come one after the other into a room
      that he might hear them, as is the fashion at a visitation. When the turn
      of Sister Marie, who had now lost her good aunt, had come, he began
      speaking to her in this wise&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sister Marie, you know of what crime you are accused, and that your
      pretence of chastity has availed you nothing, since you are well known to
      be the very contrary of chaste.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring here my accuser,&rdquo; replied Sister Marie, with steadfast countenance,
      &ldquo;and you will see whether in my presence he will abide by his evil
      declaration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No further proof is needed,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;since the confessor has been found
      guilty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hold him for too honourable a man,&rdquo; said Sister Marie, &ldquo;to have
      confessed so great a lie; but even should he have done so, bring him here
      before me, and I will prove the contrary of what he says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Prior, finding that he could in no wise move her, thereupon said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am your father, and seek to save your honour. For this reason I will
      leave the truth of the matter to your own conscience, and will believe
      whatever it bids you say. I ask you and conjure you on pain of mortal sin
      to tell me truly whether you were indeed a virgin when you were placed in
      this house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;I was then but five years old, and that age
      must in itself testify to my virginity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my daughter,&rdquo; said the Prior, &ldquo;have you not since that time lost
      this flower?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She swore that she had kept it, and that she had had no hindrance in doing
      so except from himself. Whereto he replied that he could not believe it,
      and that the matter required proof.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What proof,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;would you have?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same as from the others,&rdquo; said the Prior; &ldquo;for as I am visitor of
      souls, even so am I visitor of bodies also. Your abbesses and prioresses
      have all passed through my hands, and you need have no fear if I visit
      your virginity. Wherefore throw yourself upon the bed, and lift the
      forepart of your garments over your face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have told me so much of your wicked love for me,&rdquo; Sister Marie
      replied in wrath, &ldquo;that I think you seek rather to rob me of my virginity
      than to visit it. So understand that I shall never consent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon he said to her that she was excommunicated for refusing him the
      obedience which Holy Church commanded, and that, if she did not consent,
      he would dishonour her before the whole Chapter by declaring the evil that
      he knew of between herself and the confessor.
    </p>
    <p>
      But with fearless countenance she replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He that knows the hearts of His servants shall give me as much honour in
      His presence as you can give me shame in the presence of men; and since
      your wickedness goes so far, I would rather it wreaked its cruelty upon me
      than its evil passion; for I know that God is a just judge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the Prior departed and assembled the whole Chapter, and, causing
      Sister Marie to appear on her knees before him, he said to her with
      wondrous malignity&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sister Marie, it grieves me to see that the good counsels I have given
      you have been of no effect, and to find you fallen into such evil ways
      that, contrary to my wont, I must needs lay a penance upon you. I have
      examined your confessor concerning certain crimes with which he is
      charged, and he has confessed to me that he has abused your person in the
      place where the witnesses say that they saw him. And so I command that,
      whereas I had formerly raised you to honourable rank as Mistress of the
      Novices, you shall now be the lowest placed of all, and further, shall eat
      only bread and water on the ground, and in presence of all the Sisters,
      until you have shown sufficient penitence to receive forgiveness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sister Marie had been warned by one of her companions, who was acquainted
      with the whole matter, that if she made any reply displeasing to the
      Prior, he would put her <i>in pace</i>&mdash;that is, in perpetual
      imprisonment&mdash;and she therefore submitted to this sentence, raising
      her eyes to heaven, and praying Him who had enabled her to withstand sin,
      to grant her patience for the endurance of tribulation. The Prior of St.
      Martin&rsquo;s further commanded that for the space of three years she should
      neither speak with her mother or kinsfolk when they came to see her, nor
      send any letters save such as were written in community.
    </p>
    <p>
      The miscreant then went away and returned no more, and for a long time the
      unhappy maiden continued in the tribulation that I have described. But her
      mother, who loved her best of all her children, was much astonished at
      receiving no tidings from her; and told one of her sons, who was a prudent
      and honourable gentleman, (6) that she thought her daughter was dead, and
      that the nuns were hiding it from her in order that they might receive the
      yearly payment. She, therefore, begged him to devise some means of seeing
      his sister.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     6  It is conjectured by M. Lacroix that this &ldquo;prudent and
     honourable gentleman,&rdquo; Mary Heroet&rsquo;s brother, was Antoine
     Heroet or Hérouet, alias La Maisonneuve, who at one time was
     a valet and secretary to Queen Margaret, and so advanced
     himself in life that he died Bishop of Digne in 1544. He was
     the author of <i>La Parfaite Amie, L&rsquo;Androgyne, and De n&rsquo;aimer
     point sans être aimé</i>, poems of a semi-metaphysical, semi-
     amorous character such as might have come from Margaret&rsquo;s
     own pen. Whether he was Mary Heroet&rsquo;s brother or not, it is
     at least probable that he was her relative.-B. J. and L.
</pre>
    <p>
      He went forthwith to the convent, where he met with the wonted excuses,
      being told that for three years his sister had not stirred from her bed.
      But this did not satisfy him, and he swore that, if he did not see her, he
      would climb over the walls and force his way into the convent. Thereupon,
      being in great fear, they brought his sister to him at the grating, though
      the Abbess stood so near that she could not tell her brother aught that
      was not heard. But she had prudently set down in writing all that I have
      told you, together with a thousand others of the Prior&rsquo;s devices to
      deceive her, which &lsquo;twould take too long to relate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet I must not omit to mention that at the time when her aunt was Abbess,
      the Prior, thinking that his ugliness was the cause of her refusal, had
      caused Sister Marie to be tempted by a handsome young monk, in the hope
      that if she yielded to this man through love, he himself might afterwards
      obtain her through fear. The young monk aforesaid spoke to her in a garden
      with gestures too shameful to be mentioned, whereat the poor maiden ran to
      the Abbess, who was talking with the Prior, and cried out&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother, they are not monks, but devils, who visit us here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon the Prior, in great fear of discovery, began to laugh, and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Assuredly, mother, Sister Marie is right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, taking Sister Marie by the hand, he said to her in presence of the
      Abbess&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had heard that Sister Marie spoke very well, and so constantly that she
      was deemed to be worldly-minded. For this reason I constrained myself,
      contrary to my natural inclination, to speak to her in the way that
      worldly men speak to women&mdash;at least in books, for in point of
      experience I am as ignorant as I was on the day when I was born. Thinking,
      however, that only my years and ugliness led her to discourse in so
      virtuous a fashion, I commanded my young monk to speak to her as I myself
      had done, and, as you see, she has virtuously resisted him. So highly,
      therefore, do I think of her prudence and virtue, that henceforward she
      shall rank next after you and shall be Mistress of the Novices, to the
      intent that her excellent disposition may ever increase in virtue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This act, with many others, was done by this worthy monk during the three
      years that he was in love with the nun. She, however, as I have said, gave
      her brother in writing, through the grating, the whole story of her
      pitiful fortunes; and this her brother brought to her mother, who came,
      overwhelmed with despair, to Paris. Here she found the Queen of Navarre,
      only sister to the King, and showing her the piteous story, said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam, trust no more in these hypocrites. I thought that I had placed my
      daughter within the precincts of Paradise, or on the high road thither,
      whereas I have placed her in the precincts of Hell, and in the hands of
      the vilest devils imaginable. The devils, indeed, do not tempt us unless
      temptation be our pleasure, but these men will take by force when they
      cannot win by love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Queen of Navarre was in great concern, for she trusted wholly in the
      Prior of St. Martin&rsquo;s, to whose care she had committed her sisters-inlaw,
      the Abbesses of Montivilliers and Caen. (7) On the other hand, the
      enormity of the crime so horrified her and made her so desirous of
      avenging the innocence of this unhappy maiden, that she communicated the
      matter to the King&rsquo;s Chancellor, who happened also to be Legate in France.
      (8)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     7  The abbess of Montivilliers was Catherine d&rsquo;Albret,
     daughter of John d&rsquo;Albret, King of Navarre and sister of
     Queen Margaret&rsquo;s husband, Henry. At first a nun at the abbey
     of St. Magdalen at Orleans, she became twenty-eighth abbess
     of Montivilliers near Havre. She was still living in 1536.
     (<i>Gallia Christ</i>., vol. xi. col. 285). The abbess of Caen
     was Magdalen d&rsquo;Albret, Catherine&rsquo;s sister. She took the veil
     at Fontevrault in 1527, subsequently became thirty-third
     abbess of the Trinity at Caen, and died in November 1532.
     (<i>Gallia Christ</i>., vol. xi. col. 436).&mdash;L.

     8  This is the famous Antony Duprat, Francis I.&lsquo;s favourite
     minister. Born in 1463, he became Chancellor in 1515, and
     his wife dying soon afterwards, he took orders, with the
     result that he was made Archbishop of Sens and Cardinal. It
     was in 1530 that he was appointed Papal Legate in France, so
     that the incidents related in this tale cannot have occurred
     at an earlier date. Duprat died in July 1535, of grief, it
     is said, because Francis I. would not support him in his
     ambitious scheme to secure possession of the papal see, as
     successor to Clement VII.-B. J. and Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      The Prior was sent for, but could find nothing to plead except that he was
      seventy years of age, and addressing himself to the Queen of Navarre he
      begged that, for all the good she had ever wished to do him, and in token
      of all the services he had rendered or had desired to render her, she
      would be pleased to bring these proceedings to a close, and he would
      acknowledge that Sister Marie was a pearl of honour and chastity.
    </p>
    <p>
      On hearing this, the Queen of Navarre was so astonished that she could
      make no reply, but went off and left him there. The unhappy man then
      withdrew in great confusion to his monastery, where he would suffer none
      to see him, and where he lived only one year afterwards. And Sister Marie
      Heroet, now reputed as highly as she deserved to be, by reason of the
      virtues that God had given her, was withdrawn from the convent of Gif,
      where she had endured so much evil, and was by the King made Abbess of the
      the convent of Giy (9) near Montargis.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     9  Giy-les-Nonains, a little village on the river Ouanne, at
     two leagues and a half from Montargis, department of the
     Loiret.&mdash;L.
</pre>
    <p>
      This convent she reformed, and there she lived like one filled with the
      Spirit of God, whom all her life long she ever praised for having of His
      good grace restored to her both honour and repose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, ladies, you have a story which clearly proves the words of the
      Gospel, that &lsquo;God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the
      things which are mighty, and things which are despised of men hath God
      chosen to bring to nought the glory of those who think themselves
      something but are in truth nothing.&rsquo; (10) And remember, ladies, that
      without the grace of God there is no good at all in man, just as there is
      no temptation that with His assistance may not be overcome. This is shown
      by the abasement of the man who was accounted just, and the exaltation of
      her whom men were willing to deem a wicked sinner. Thus are verified Our
      Lord&rsquo;s words, &lsquo;Whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that
      humbleth himself shall be exalted.&rsquo;&rdquo; (11)

      undertake such a task. Moreover, in telling your tale you have reminded me
      of a very pitiful story which I feel constrained to relate, seeing that I
      am not far from the place where, in my own time, the thing came to pass. I
      shall tell it also, ladies, to the end that the hypocrisy of those who
      account themselves more religious than their neighbours, may not so
      beguile your understanding as to turn your faith out of the right path,
      and lead you to hope for salvation from any other than Him who has chosen
      to stand alone in the work of our creation and redemption. He is all
      powerful to save us unto life eternal, and, in this temporal life, to
      comfort us and deliver us from all our tribulations. And knowing that
      Satan often transforms himself into an angel of light so that the outward
      eye, blinded by the semblance of holiness and devotion, cannot apprehend
      that from which we ought to flee, I think it well to tell you this tale,
      which came to pass in our own time.&rdquo;

      <i>TALE XXIII</i>.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>The excessive reverence shown by a gentleman of Périgord to
     the Order of St. Francis, brought about the miserable death
     of his wife, his little child and himself</i>. (1)

     1  Etienne introduces this tale into his <i>Apologie pour
     Hérodote</i>, ch. xxi.&mdash;B. J.
</pre>
    <p>
      In the county of Périgord dwelt a gentleman whose devotion to St. Francis
      was such that in his eyes all who wore the saint&rsquo;s robe must needs be as
      holy as the saint himself. To do honour to the latter, he had caused rooms
      and closets to be furnished in his house for the lodgment of the brethren,
      and he regulated all his affairs by their advice, even to the most
      trifling household matters, believing that he must needs pursue the right
      path if he followed their good counsels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it happened that this gentleman&rsquo;s wife, who was a beautiful woman and
      as discreet as she was virtuous, was brought to bed of a fine boy, whereat
      the love which her husband bore her was increased twofold. One day, in
      order to entertain his dear, he sent for one of his brothers-in-law, and
      just as the hour for supper was drawing nigh, there arrived also a Grey
      Friar, whose name I will keep secret out of regard for his Order. The
      gentleman was well pleased to see his spiritual father, from whom he had
      no secrets, and after much talk among his wife, his brother-in-law and the
      monk, they sat down to supper. While they were at table the gentleman cast
      his eyes upon his wife, who was indeed beautiful and graceful enough to be
      desired of a husband, and thereupon asked this question aloud of the
      worthy father&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it true, father, that a man commits mortal sin if he lies with his
      wife at the time of her lying-in?&rdquo; (2)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     2  Meaning the period between her delivery and her
     churching.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      The worthy father, whose speech and countenance belied his heart, answered
      with an angry look&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Undoubtedly, sir, I hold this to be one of the very greatest sins that
      can be committed in the married state. The blessed Virgin Mary would not
      enter the temple until the days of her purification were accomplished,
      although she had no need of these; and if she, in order to obey the law,
      refrained from going to the temple wherein was all her consolation, you
      should of a surety not fail to abstain from such slight pleasure.
      Moreover, physicians say that there is great risk to the offspring so
      begotten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the gentleman heard these words, he was greatly downcast, for he had
      hoped that the good Friar would give him the permission he sought;
      however, he said no more. Meanwhile the worthy father, who had drunk more
      than was needful, looked at the lady, (3) thinking to himself that, if he
      were her husband, he would ask no Friar&rsquo;s advice before lying with her;
      and just as a fire kindles little by little until at last it envelops the
      whole house, so this monk began to burn with such exceeding lust that he
      suddenly resolved to satisfy a desire which for three years he had carried
      hidden in his heart.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     3  The French word here is <i>damoiselle</i>, by which
     appellation the lady is called throughout the story. Her
     husband, being a petty nobleman, was a <i>damoiseau</i>, whence
     the name given to his wife. The word <i>damoiselle</i> is
     frequently employed in the <i>Heptameron</i>, and though
     sometimes it merely signifies an attendant on a lady, the
     reference is more frequently to a woman of gentle birth,
     whether she be spinster, wife or widow. Only women of high
     nobility and of the blood royal were at that time called
     <i>Madame</i>.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      After the tables had been withdrawn, he took the gentleman by the hand,
      and, leading him to his wife&rsquo;s bedside, (4) said to him in her presence&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It moves my pity, sir, to see the great love which exists between you and
      this lady, and which, added to your extreme youth, torments you so sore. I
      have therefore determined to tell you a secret of our sacred theology
      which is that, although the rule be made thus strict by reason of the
      abuses committed by indiscreet husbands, it does not suffer that such as
      are of good conscience like you should be balked of all intercourse. If
      then, sir, before others I have stated in all its severity the command of
      the law, I will now reveal to you, who are a prudent man, its mildness
      also. Know then, my son, that there are women and women, just as there are
      men and men. In the first place, my lady here must tell us whether, three
      weeks having gone by since her delivery, the flow of blood has quite
      ceased?&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     4  The supper would appear to have been served in the
     bedroom, and the tables were taken away as soon as the
     repast was over. It seems to us very ridiculous when on the
     modern stage we see a couple of lackeys bring in a table
     laden with viands and carry it away again as soon as the
     <i>dramatis personæ</i> have dined or supped. Yet this was the
     common practice in France in Queen Margaret&rsquo;s time.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      The lady replied that it had.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the Friar, &ldquo;I permit you to lie with her without scruple,
      provided that you are willing to promise me two things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman replied that he was willing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first,&rdquo; said the good father, &ldquo;is that you speak to no one concerning
      this matter, but come here in secret. The second is that you do not come
      until two hours after midnight, so that the good lady&rsquo;s digestion be not
      hindered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These things the gentleman promised; and he confirmed his promise with so
      strong an oath that the other, knowing him to be foolish rather than
      false, was quite satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      After much converse the good father withdrew to his chamber, giving them
      good-night and an abundant blessing. But, as he was going, he took the
      gentleman by the hand, and said to him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You too, sir, i&rsquo; faith must come, nor keep your poor lady longer awake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon the gentleman kissed her. &ldquo;Sweetheart,&rdquo; said he, and the good
      father heard him plainly, &ldquo;leave the door of your room open for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so each withdrew to his own chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      On leaving them the Friar gave no heed to sleep or to repose, and, as soon
      as all the noises in the house were still, he went as softly as possible
      straight to the lady&rsquo;s chamber, at about the hour when he was wont to go
      to matins, and finding the door open in expectation of the master&rsquo;s
      coming, he went in, cleverly put out the light, and speedily got into bed
      with the lady, without speaking a single word.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady, believing him to be her husband, said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is this, love? you have kept but poorly the promise you gave last
      evening to our confessor that you would not come here before two o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Friar, who was more eager for action than for contemplation, and who,
      moreover, was fearful of being recognised, gave more thought to satisfying
      the wicked desires that had long poisoned his heart than to giving her any
      reply; whereat the lady wondered greatly. When the friar found the
      husband&rsquo;s hour drawing near, he rose from the lady&rsquo;s side and returned
      with all speed to his own chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, just as the frenzy of lust had robbed him of sleep, so now the fear
      that always follows upon wickedness would not suffer him to rest.
      Accordingly, he went to the porter of the house and said to him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friend, your master has charged me to go without delay and offer up
      prayers for him at our convent, where he is accustomed to perform his
      devotions. Wherefore, I pray you, give me my horse and open the door
      without letting any one be the wiser; for the mission is both pressing and
      secret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The porter knew that obedience to the Friar was service acceptable to his
      master, and so he opened the door secretly and let him out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just at that time the gentleman awoke. Finding that it was close on the
      hour which the good father had appointed him for visiting his wife, he got
      up in his bedgown and repaired swiftly to that bed whither by God&rsquo;s
      ordinance, and without need of the license of man, it was lawful for him
      to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      When his wife heard him speaking beside her, she was greatly astonished,
      and, not knowing what had occurred, said to him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, sir, is it possible that, after your promise to the good father to
      be heedful of your own health and of mine, you not only come before the
      hour appointed, but even return a second time? Think on it, sir, I pray
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On hearing this, the gentleman was so much disconcerted that he could not
      conceal it, and said to her&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do these words mean? I know of a truth that I have not lain with you
      for three weeks, and yet you rebuke me for coming too often. If you
      continue to talk in this way, you will make me think that my company is
      irksome to you, and will drive me, contrary to my wont and will, to seek
      elsewhere that pleasure which, by the law of God, I should have with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lady thought that he was jesting, and replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pray you, sir, deceive not yourself in seeking to deceive me; for
      although you said nothing when you came, I knew very well that you were
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the gentleman saw that they had both been deceived, and solemnly
      vowed to her that he had not been with her before; whereat the lady,
      weeping in dire distress, besought him to find out with all despatch who
      it could have been, seeing that besides themselves only his brother-in-law
      and the Friar slept in the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Impelled by suspicion of the Friar, the gentleman forthwith went in all
      haste to the room where he had been lodged, and found it empty; whereupon,
      to make yet more certain whether he had fled, he sent for the man who kept
      the door, and asked him whether he knew what had become of the Friar. And
      the man told him the whole truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman, being now convinced of the Friar&rsquo;s wickedness, returned to
      his wife&rsquo;s room, and said to her&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of a certainty, sweetheart, the man who lay with you and did such fine
      things was our Father Confessor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lady, who all her life long had held her honour dear, was overwhelmed
      with despair, and laying aside all humanity and womanly nature, besought
      her husband on her knees to avenge this foul wrong; whereupon the
      gentleman immediately mounted his horse and went in pursuit of the Friar.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady remained all alone in her bed, with no counsel or comfort near
      her but her little newborn child. She reflected upon the strange and
      horrible adventure that had befallen her, and, without making any excuse
      for her ignorance, deemed herself guilty as well as the unhappiest woman
      in the world. She had never learned aught of the Friars, save to have
      confidence in good works, and seek atonement for sins by austerity of
      life, fasting and discipline; she was wholly ignorant of the pardon
      granted by our good God through the merits of His Son, the remission of
      sins by His blood, the reconciliation of the Father with us through His
      death, and the life given to sinners by His sole goodness and mercy; and
      so, assailed by despair based on the enormity and magnitude of her sin,
      the love of her husband and the honour of her house, she thought that
      death would be far happier than such a life as hers. And, overcome by
      sorrow, she fell into such despair that she was not only turned aside from
      the hope which every Christian should have in God, but she forgot her own
      nature, and was wholly bereft of common sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, overpowered by grief, and driven by despair from all knowledge of
      God and herself, this frenzied, frantic woman took a cord from the bed and
      strangled herself with her own hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      And worse even than this, amidst the agony of this cruel death, whilst her
      body was struggling against it, she set her foot upon the face of her
      little child, whose innocence did not avail to save it from following in
      death its sorrowful and suffering mother. While dying, however, the infant
      uttered so piercing a cry that a woman who slept in the room rose in great
      haste and lit the candle. Then, seeing her mistress hanging strangled by
      the bed-cord, and the child stifled and dead under her feet, she ran in
      great affright to the apartment of her mistress&rsquo;s brother, and brought him
      to see the pitiful sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The brother, after giving way to such grief as was natural and fitting in
      one who loved his sister with his whole heart, asked the serving-woman who
      it was that had committed this terrible crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      She replied that she did not know; but that no one had entered the room
      excepting her master, and he had but lately left it. The brother then went
      to the gentleman&rsquo;s room, and not finding him there, felt sure that he had
      done the deed. So, mounting his horse without further inquiry, he hastened
      in pursuit and met with him on the road as he was returning disconsolate
      at not having been able to overtake the Grey Friar.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the lady&rsquo;s brother saw his brother-in-law, he cried out to him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Villain and coward, defend yourself, for I trust that God will by this
      sword avenge me on you this day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman would have expostulated, but his brother-in-law&rsquo;s sword was
      pressing so close upon him that he found it of more importance to defend
      himself than to inquire the reason of the quarrel; whereupon each dealt
      the other so many wounds that they were at last compelled by weariness and
      loss of blood to sit down on the ground face to face.
    </p>
    <p>
      And while they were recovering breath, the gentleman asked&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What cause, brother, has turned our deep and unbroken friendship to such
      cruel strife as this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; replied the brother-in-law, &ldquo;what cause has moved you to slay my
      sister, the most excellent woman that ever lived, and this in so cowardly
      a fashion that under pretence of sleeping with her you have hanged and
      strangled her with the bed-cord?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On hearing these words the gentleman, more dead than alive, came to his
      brother, and putting his arms around him, said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it possible that you have found your sister in the state you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The brother-in-law assured him that it was indeed so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pray you, brother,&rdquo; the gentleman thereupon replied, &ldquo;hearken to the
      reason why I left the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Forthwith he told him all about the wicked Grey Friar, whereat his
      brother-in-law was greatly astonished, and still more grieved that he
      should have unjustly attacked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Entreating pardon, he said to him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have wronged you; forgive me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you were ever wronged by me,&rdquo; replied the gentleman, &ldquo;I have been well
      punished, for I am so sorely wounded that I cannot hope to recover.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the brother-in-law put him on horseback again as well as he might,
      and brought him back to the house, where on the morrow he died. And the
      brother-in-law confessed in presence of all the gentleman&rsquo;s relatives that
      he had been the cause of his death.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, for the satisfaction of justice, he was advised to go and solicit
      pardon from King Francis, first of the name; and accordingly, after giving
      honourable burial to husband, wife and child, he departed on Good Friday
      to the Court in order to sue there for pardon, which he obtained through
      the good offices of Master Francis Olivier, then Chancellor of Alençon,
      afterwards chosen by the King, for his merits, to be Chancellor of France.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     5  M. de Montaiglon has vainly searched the French Archives
     for the letters of remission granted to the gentleman. There
     is no mention of them in the registers of the Trésor des
     Chartes. Francis Olivier, alluded to above, was one of the
     most famous magistrates of the sixteenth century. Son of
     James Olivier, First President of the Parliament of Paris
     and Bishop of Angers, he was born in 1493 and became
     successively advocate, member of the Grand Council,
     ambassador, Chancellor of Alençon, President of the Paris
     Parliament, Keeper of the Seals and Chancellor of France.
     This latter dignity was conferred upon him through Queen
     Margaret&rsquo;s influence in April 1545. The above tale must have
     been written subsequent to that date. Olivier&rsquo;s talents were
     still held in high esteem under both Henry II. and Francis
     II.; he died in 1590, aged 67.&mdash;(Blanchard&rsquo;s <i>Éloges de tous
     les Présidents du Parlement, &amp;c</i>., Paris, 1645, in-fol. p.
     185.)

     Ste. Marthe, in his funeral oration on Queen Margaret,
     refers to Olivier in the following pompous strain: &ldquo;When
     Brinon died Chancellor of this duchy of Alençon, Francis
     Olivier was set in his place, and so greatly adorned this
     dignity by his admirable virtues, and so increased the
     grandeur of the office of Chancellor, that, like one of
     exceeding merit on whom Divine Providence, disposing of the
     affairs of France, has conferred a more exalted office, he
     is today raised to the highest degree of honour, and, even
     as Atlas upholds the Heavens upon his shoulders, so he by
     his prudence doth uphold the entire Gallic commonwealth.&rdquo;&mdash;
     M. L. and Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am of opinion, ladies, that after hearing this true story there is none
      among you but will think twice before lodging such knaves in her house,
      and will be persuaded that hidden poison is always the most dangerous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;that the husband was a great fool to bring such
      a gallant to sup with his fair and virtuous wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have known the time,&rdquo; said Geburon, &ldquo;when in our part of the country
      there was not a house but had a room set apart for the good fathers; but
      now they are known so well that they are dreaded more than bandits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;that when a woman is in bed she should
      never allow a priest to enter the room, unless it be to administer to her
      the sacraments of the Church. For my own part, when I send for them, I may
      indeed be deemed at the point of death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If every one were as strict as you are,&rdquo; said Ennasuite, &ldquo;the poor
      priests would be worse than excommunicated, in being wholly shut off from
      the sight of women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have no such fear on their account,&rdquo; said Saffredent; &ldquo;they will never
      want for women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Simontault, &ldquo;&lsquo;tis the very men that have united us to our
      wives by the marriage tie that wickedly seek to loose it and bring about
      the breaking of the oath which they have themselves laid upon us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a great pity,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;that those who administer the
      sacraments should thus trifle with them. They ought to be burned alive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would do better to honour rather than blame them,&rdquo; said Saffredent,
      &ldquo;and to flatter rather than revile them, for they are men who have it in
      their power to burn and dishonour others. Wherefore &lsquo;<i>sinite eos</i>,&rsquo;
      and let us see to whom Oisille will give her vote.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I give it,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;to Dagoucin, for he has become so thoughtful that
      I think he must have made ready to tell us something good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since I cannot and dare not reply as I would,&rdquo; said Dagoucin, &ldquo;I will at
      least tell of a man to whom similar cruelty at first brought hurt but
      afterwards profit. Although Love accounts himself so strong and powerful
      that he will go naked, and finds it irksome, nay intolerable, to go
      cloaked, nevertheless, ladies, it often happens that those who, following
      his counsel, are over-quick in declaring themselves, find themselves the
      worse for it. Such was the experience of a Castilian gentleman, whose
      story you shall now hear.&rdquo;

      <i>TALE XXIV</i>.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>Elisor, having unwisely ventured to discover his love to
     the Queen of Castile, was by her put to the test in so cruel
     a fashion that he suffered sorely, yet did he reap advantage
     therefrom</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      In the household of the King and Queen of Castile, (1) whose names shall
      not be mentioned, there was a gentleman of such perfection in all
      qualities of mind and body, that his like could not be found in all the
      Spains. All wondered at his merits, but still more at the strangeness of
      his temper, for he had never been known to love or have connection with
      any lady. There were very many at Court that might have set his icy nature
      afire, but there was not one among them whose charms had power to attract
      Elisor; for so this gentleman was called.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  M. Lacroix conjectures that the sovereigns referred to
     are Ferdinand and Isabella, but this appears to us a
     baseless supposition. The conduct of the Queen in the story
     is in no wise in keeping with what we know of Isabella&rsquo;s
     character. Queen Margaret doubtless heard this tale during
     her sojourn in Spain in 1525. We have consulted many Spanish
     works, and notably collections of the old ballads, in the
     hope of being able to throw some light on the incidents
     related, but have been no more successful than previous
     commentators.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      The Queen, who was a virtuous woman but by no means free from that flame
      which proves all the fiercer the less it is perceived, was much astonished
      to find that this gentleman loved none of her ladies; and one day she
      asked him whether it were possible that he could indeed love as little as
      he seemed to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      He replied that if she could look upon his heart as she did his face, she
      would not ask him such a question. Desiring to know his meaning, she
      pressed him so closely that he confessed he loved a lady whom he deemed
      the most virtuous in all Christendom. The Queen did all that she could by
      entreaties and commands to find out who the lady might be, but in vain;
      whereupon, feigning great wrath, she vowed that she would never speak to
      him any more if he did not tell her the name of the lady he so dearly
      loved. At this he was greatly disturbed, and was constrained to say that
      he would rather die, if need were, than name her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finding, however, that he would lose the Queen&rsquo;s presence and favour in
      default of telling her a thing in itself so honourable that it ought not
      to be taken in ill part by any one, he said to her in great fear&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot and dare not tell you, madam, but the first time you go hunting
      I will show her to you, and I feel sure that you will deem her the fairest
      and most perfect lady in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This reply caused the Queen to go hunting sooner than she would otherwise
      have done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elisor, having notice of this, made ready to attend her as was his wont,
      and caused a large steel mirror after the fashion of a corselet to be made
      for him, which he placed upon his breast and covered with a cloak of black
      frieze, bordered with purflew and gold braid. He was mounted on a
      coal-black steed, well caparisoned with everything needful to the
      equipment of a horse, and such part of this as was metal was wholly of
      gold, wrought with black enamel in the Moorish style. (2)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     2  Damascened.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      His hat was of black silk, and to it was fastened a rich medal on which by
      way of device was engraved the god of Love subdued by Force, the whole
      enriched with precious stones. His sword and dagger were no less
      handsomely and choicely ordered. In a word, he was most bravely equipped,
      while so skilled was his horsemanship that all who saw him left the
      pleasures of the chase to watch the leaps and paces of his steed.
    </p>
    <p>
      After bringing the Queen in this fashion to the place where the nets were
      spread, he dismounted from his noble horse and went to assist the Queen to
      alight from her palfrey. And whilst she was stretching out her hands to
      him, he threw his cloak back from before his breast, and taking her in his
      arms, showed her his corselet-mirror, saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pray you, madam, look here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, without waiting for her reply, he set her down gently upon the
      ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the hunt was over, the Queen returned to the castle without speaking
      to Elisor, but after supper she called him to her and told him that he was
      the greatest liar she had ever seen; for he had promised to show her at
      the hunt the lady whom he loved the best, but had not done so, for which
      reason she was resolved to hold him in esteem no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elisor, fearing that the Queen had not understood the words he had spoken
      to her, answered that he had indeed obeyed her, for he had shown her not
      merely the woman but the thing also, that he loved best in all the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pretending that she did not understand him, she replied that he had not,
      to her knowledge, shown her a single one among her ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true, madam,&rdquo; said Elisor, &ldquo;but what did I show you when I helped
      you off your horse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said the Queen, &ldquo;except a mirror on your breast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what did you see in the mirror?&rdquo; said Elisor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw nothing but myself,&rdquo; replied the Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, madam,&rdquo; said Elisor, &ldquo;I have kept faith with you and obeyed your
      command. There is not, nor ever will there be, another image in my heart
      save that which you saw upon my breast. Her alone will I love, reverence
      and worship, not as a woman merely, but as my very God on earth, in whose
      hands I place my life or my death, entreating her withal that the deep and
      perfect affection, which was my life whilst it remained concealed, may not
      prove my death now that it is discovered. And though I be not worthy that
      you should look on me or accept me for your lover, at least suffer me to
      live, as hitherto, in the happy consciousness that my heart has chosen so
      perfect and so worthy an object for its love, wherefrom I can have no
      other satisfaction than the knowledge that my love is deep and perfect,
      seeing that I must be content to love without hope of return. And if, now
      knowing this great love of mine, you should not be pleased to favour me
      more than heretofore, at least do not deprive me of life, which for me
      consists wholly in the delight of seeing you as usual. I now have from you
      nought but what my utmost need requires, and should I have less, you will
      have a servant the less, for you will lose the best and most devoted that
      you have ever had or could ever look to have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Queen&mdash;whether to show herself other than she really was, or to
      thoroughly try the love he bore her, or because she loved another whom she
      would not cast off, or because she wished to hold him in reserve to put
      him in the place of her actual lover should the latter give her any
      offence&mdash;said to him, with a countenance that showed neither anger
      nor content&mdash;&ldquo;Elisor, I will not feign ignorance of the potency of
      love, and say aught to you concerning your foolishness in aiming at so
      high and hard a thing as the love of me; for I know that man&rsquo;s heart is so
      little under his own control, that he cannot love or hate at will. But,
      since you have concealed your feelings so well, I would fain know how long
      it is since you first entertained them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Elisor, gazing at her beauteous face and hearing her thus inquire
      concerning his sickness, hoped that she might be willing to afford him a
      remedy. But at the same time, observing the grave and staid expression of
      her countenance, he became afraid, feeling himself to be in the presence
      of a judge whose sentence, he suspected, would be against him.
      Nevertheless he swore to her that this love had taken root in his heart in
      the days of his earliest youth, though it was only during the past seven
      years that it had caused him pain,&mdash;and yet, in truth, not pain, but
      so pleasing a sickness that its cure would be his death.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since you have displayed such lengthened steadfastness,&rdquo; said the Queen,
      &ldquo;I must not show more haste in believing you, than you have shown in
      telling me of your affection. If, therefore, it be as you say, I will so
      test your sincerity that I shall never afterwards be able to doubt it; and
      having proved your pain, I will hold you to be towards me such as you
      yourself swear you are; and on my knowing you to be what you say, you, for
      your part, shall find me to be what you desire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Elisor begged her to test him in any way she pleased, there being nothing,
      he said, so difficult that it would not appear very easy to him, if he
      might have the honour of proving his love to her; and accordingly he
      begged her once more to command him as to what she would to have him do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Elisor,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;if you love me as much as you say, I am sure that
      you will deem nothing hard of accomplishment if only it may bring you my
      favour. I therefore command you, by your desire of winning it and your
      fear of losing it, to depart hence to-morrow morning without seeing me
      again, and to repair to some place where, until this day seven years, you
      shall hear nothing of me nor I anything of you. You, who have had seven
      years&rsquo; experience of this love, know that you do indeed love me; and when
      I have had a like experience, I too shall know and believe what your words
      cannot now make me either believe or understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Elisor heard this cruel command, he on the one hand suspected that
      she desired to remove him from her presence, yet, on the other, he hoped
      that this proof would plead more eloquently for him than any words he
      could utter. He therefore submitted to her command, and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For seven years I have lived hopeless, bearing in my breast a hidden
      flame; now, however, that this is known to you, I shall spend these other
      seven years in patience and trust. But, madam, while I obey your command,
      which robs me of all the happiness that I have heretofore had in the
      world, what hope will you give me that at the end of the seven years you
      will accept me as your faithful and devoted lover?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is a ring,&rdquo; said the Queen, drawing one from her finger, &ldquo;which we
      will cut in two. I will keep one half, and you shall keep the other, (3)
      so that I may know you by this token, if the lapse of time should cause me
      to forget your face.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     3  This was a common practice at the time between lovers, and
     even between husbands and wives. There is the familiar but
     doubtful story of Frances de Foix, Countess of
     Châteaubriant, who became Francis I.&lsquo;s mistress, and who is
     said to have divided a ring in this manner with her husband,
     it being understood between them that she was not to repair
     to Court, or even leave her residence in Brittany, unless
     her husband sent her as a token the half of the ring which
     he had kept. Francis I., we are told, heard of this, and
     causing a ring of the same pattern to be made, he sent half
     of it to the Countess, who thereupon came to Court,
     imagining that it was her husband who summoned her. Whether
     the story be true or not, it should be mentioned that the
     sole authority for it is Varillas, whose errors and
     inventions are innumerable.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      Elisor took the ring and broke it in two, giving one half of it to the
      Queen, and keeping the other himself. Then, more corpse-like than those
      who have given up the ghost, he took his leave, and went to his lodging to
      give orders for his departure. In doing this he sent all his attendants to
      his house, and departed alone with one servingman to so solitary a spot
      that none of his friends or kinsfolk could obtain tidings of him during
      the seven years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the life that he led during this time, and the grief that he endured
      through this banishment, nothing is recorded, but lovers cannot be
      ignorant of their nature. At the end of the seven years, just as the Queen
      was one day going to mass, a hermit with a long beard came to her, kissed
      her hand, and presented her with a petition. This she did not look at
      immediately, although it was her custom to receive in her own hands all
      the petitions that were presented to her, no matter how poor the
      petitioners might be.
    </p>
    <p>
      When mass was half over, however, she opened the petition, and found in it
      the half-ring which she had given to Elisor. At this she was not less glad
      than astonished, and before reading the contents she instantly commanded
      her almoner to bring her the tall hermit who had presented her the
      petition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The almoner looked for him everywhere, but could obtain no tidings of him,
      except that some one said that he had seen him mount a horse, but knew not
      what road he had taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst she was waiting for the almoner&rsquo;s return, the Queen read the
      petition, which she found to be an epistle in verse, written in the best
      style imaginable; and were it not that I would have you acquainted with
      it, I should never have dared to translate it; for you must know, ladies,
      that, for grace and expression, the Castilian is beyond compare the tongue
      which is best fitted to set forth the passion of love. The matter of the
      letter was as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Time, by his puissance stern, his sov&rsquo;reign might,
     Hath made me learn love&rsquo;s character aright;
     And, bringing with him, in his gloomy train,
     The speechless eloquence of bitter pain,
     Hath caused the unbelieving one to know
     What words of love were impotent to show.
     Time made my heart, aforetime, meekly bow
     Unto the mastery of love; but now
     Time hath, at last, revealed love to be
     Far other than it once appeared to me;
     And Time the frail foundation hath made clear
     Whereon I purposed, once, my love to rear&mdash;
     To wit, your beauty, which but served as sheath
     To hide the cruelty that lurked beneath.

     Yea, Time hath shown me beauty&rsquo;s nothingness
     And taught me e&rsquo;en your cruelty to bless,
     That cruelty which banished me the place
     Where I, at least, had gazed upon your face.
     And when no more I saw your beauty beam
     The harsher yet your cruelty did seem;
     Yet in obedience failed I not, and this
     Hath been the means of compassing my bliss.
     For Time, love&rsquo;s parent, pitiful at last,
     Upon my woe commiserate eyes hath cast,
     And done to me so excellent a turn,
     That, if I now come back, think not I yearn
     To sigh and dally, and renew the spell&mdash;
     I only come to bid a last farewell.

     Time, the revealer, hath not failed to prove
     How base and sorry is all human love,
     So that through Time, I now that time regret
     When all my fancy upon love was set,
     For then Time wasted was, lost in love&rsquo;s chains,
     Sorrow whereof is all that now remains.
     And Time in teaching me <i>that</i> love&rsquo;s deceit
     Hath brought another, far more pure and sweet,
     To dwell within me, in the lonely spot
     Where tears and silence long have been my lot.
     Time, to my heart, that higher love hath brought
     With which the lower can no more be sought;
     Time hath the latter into exile driven,
     And, to the first, myself hath wholly given,
     And consecrated to its service true
     The heart and hand I erst had given to you.

     When I was yours you nothing showed of grace,
     And I that nothing loved, for your fair face;
     Then, death for loyalty, you sought to give,
     And I, in fleeing it, have learnt to live.
     For, by the tender love that Time hath brought
     The other vanquished is, and turned to nought;
     Once did it lure and lull me, but I swear
     It now hath wholly vanished in thin air.
     And so your love and you I gladly leave,
     And, needing neither, will forbear to grieve;
     The other perfect, lasting love is mine,
     To it I turn, nor for the lost one pine.

     My leave I take of cruelty and pain,
     Of hatred, bitter torment, cold disdain,
     And those hot flames which fill you, and which fire
     Him, that beholds your beauty, with desire.
     Nor can I better part from ev&rsquo;ry throe,
     From ev&rsquo;ry evil hap, and stress of woe,
     And the fierce passion of love&rsquo;s awful hell,
     Than by this single utterance: <i>Farewell</i>.
     Learn therefore, that whate&rsquo;er may be in store,
     Each other&rsquo;s faces we shall see no more.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This letter was not read without many tears and much astonishment on the
      Queen&rsquo;s part, together with regret surpassing belief; for the loss of a
      lover filled with so perfect a love must needs have been keenly felt; and
      not all her treasures, nor even her kingdom itself, could hinder the Queen
      from being the poorest and most wretched lady in the world, seeing that
      she had lost that which all the world&rsquo;s wealth could not replace. And
      having heard mass to the end and returned to her apartment, she there made
      such mourning as her cruelty had provoked. And there was not a mountain, a
      rock or a forest to which she did not send in quest of the hermit; but He
      who had withdrawn him out of her hands preserved him from falling into
      them again, and took him away to Paradise before she could gain tidings of
      him in this world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This instance shows that a lover should never acknowledge that which may
      do him harm and in no wise help him. And still less, ladies, should you in
      your incredulity demand so hard a test, lest in getting your proof you
      lose your lover.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truly, Dagoucin,&rdquo; said Geburon, &ldquo;I had all my life long deemed the lady
      of your story to be the most virtuous in the world, but now I hold her for
      the most cruel woman that ever lived.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;it seems to me that she did him no wrong
      in wishing to try him for seven years, in order to see whether he did love
      her as much as he said. Men are so wont to speak falsely in these matters
      that before trusting them, if indeed one trust them at all, one cannot put
      them to the proof too long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ladies of our day,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;are far wiser than those of past
      times, for they are as sure of a lover after a seven days&rsquo; trial as the
      others were after seven years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet there are those in this company,&rdquo; said Longarine, &ldquo;who have been
      loved with all earnestness for seven years and more, and albeit have not
      been won.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Fore God,&rdquo; said Simontault, &ldquo;you speak the truth; but such as they ought
      to be ranked with the ladies of former times, for they cannot be
      recognised as belonging to the present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;the gentleman was much beholden to the lady,
      for it was owing to her that he devoted his heart wholly to God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was very fortunate for him,&rdquo; said Saffredent, &ldquo;that he found God upon
      the way, for, considering the grief he was in, I am surprised that he did
      not give himself to the devil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And did you give yourself to such a master,&rdquo; asked Ennasuite, &ldquo;when your
      lady ill used you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, thousands of times,&rdquo; said Saffredent, &ldquo;but the devil, seeing that
      all the torments of hell could bring me no more suffering than those which
      she caused me to endure, never condescended to take me. He knew full well
      that no devil is so bad as a lady who is deeply loved and will make no
      return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I were you,&rdquo; said Parlamente to Saffredent, &ldquo;and held such an opinion
      as that, I would never make love to woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My affection,&rdquo; said Saffredent, &ldquo;and my folly are always so great, that
      where I cannot command I am well content to serve. All the ill-will of the
      ladies cannot subdue the love that I bear them. But, I pray you, tell me
      on your conscience, do you praise this lady for such great harshness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;I do, for I think that she wished neither to receive
      love nor to bestow it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If such was her mind,&rdquo; said Simontault, &ldquo;why did she hold out to him the
      hope of being loved after the seven years were past?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am of your opinion,&rdquo; said Longarine, &ldquo;for ladies who are unwilling to
      love give no occasion for the continuance of the love that is offered
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Nomerfide, &ldquo;she loved some one else less worthy than that
      honourable gentleman, and so forsook the better for the worse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;T faith,&rdquo; said Saffredent, &ldquo;I think that she meant to keep him in
      readiness and take him whenever she might leave the other whom for the
      time she loved the best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can see,&rdquo; said Oisille, (4) &ldquo;that the more we talk in this way, the
      more those who would not be harshly treated will do their utmost to speak
      ill of us. Wherefore, Dagoucin, I pray you give some lady your vote.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     4  Prior to this sentence the following passage occurs in
     the De Thou MS.: &ldquo;When Madame Oysille saw that the men,
     under pretence of censuring the Queen of Castille for
     conduct which certainly cannot be praised either in her or
     in any other, continued saying so much evil of women, that
     the most discreet and virtuous were spared no more than the
     most foolish and wanton, she could endure it no longer, but
     spoke and said,&rdquo; &amp;c.&mdash;L.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I give it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to Longarine, for I feel sure that she will tell us
      no melancholy story, and that she will speak the truth without sparing man
      or woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since you deem me so truthful,&rdquo; said Longarine, &ldquo;I will be so bold as to
      relate an adventure that befel a very great Prince, who surpasses in worth
      all others of his time. Lying and dissimulation are, indeed, things not to
      be employed save in cases of extreme necessity; they are foul and infamous
      vices, more especially in Princes and great lords, on whose lips and
      features truth sits more becomingly than on those of other men. But no
      Prince in the world however great he be, even though he have all the
      honours and wealth he may desire, can escape being subject to the empire
      and tyranny of Love; indeed it would seem that the nobler and more
      high-minded the Prince, the more does Love strive to bring him under his
      mighty hand. For this glorious God sets no store by common things; his
      majesty rejoices solely in the daily working of miracles, such as
      weakening the strong, strengthening the weak, giving knowledge to the
      simple, taking intelligence from the most learned, favouring the passions,
      and overthrowing the reason. In such transformations as these does the
      Deity of Love delight. Now since Princes are not exempt from love&rsquo;s
      thraldom, so also are they not free from its necessities, and must
      therefore perforce be permitted to employ falsehood, hypocrisy and deceit,
      which, according to the teaching of Master Jehan de Mehun, (5) are the
      means to be employed for vanquishing our enemies. And, since such conduct
      is praiseworthy on the part of a Prince in such a case as this (though in
      any other it were deserving of blame), I will relate to you the devices to
      which a young Prince resorted, and by which he contrived to deceive those
      who are wont to deceive the whole world.&rdquo;

      <i>TALE XXV</i>.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>A young Prince, whilst pretending to visit his lawyer and
     talk with him of his affairs, conversed so freely with the
     lawyer&rsquo;s wife, that he obtained from her what he desired</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      In the city of Paris there dwelt an advocate who was more highly thought
      of than any other of his condition, (1) and who, being sought after by
      every one on account of his excellent parts, had become the richest of all
      those who wore the gown.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  In five of the oldest MSS. of the <i>Heptameron</i>, and in
     the original editions of 1558, 1559, and 1560, the words are
     &ldquo;than nine others of his condition.&rdquo; The explanation of this
     is, that the advocate&rsquo;s name, as ascertained by Baron Jerome
     Pichon, was Disome, which, written Dix-hommes, would
     literally mean &ldquo;ten men.&rdquo; Baron Pichon has largely
     elucidated this story, and the essential points of his
     notice, contributed to the <i>Mélanges de la Société des
     Bibliophiles Français</i>, will be found summarized in the
     Appendix to this volume, B.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      Now, although he had had no children by his first wife, he was in hopes of
      having some by a second; for, although his body was no longer hearty, his
      heart and hopes were as much alive as ever. Accordingly, he made choice of
      one of the fairest maidens in the city; she was between eighteen and
      nineteen years of age, very handsome both in features and complexion, and
      still more handsome in figure. He loved her and treated her as well as
      could be; but he had no children by her any more than by his first wife,
      and this at last made her unhappy. And as youth cannot endure grief, she
      sought diversion away from home, and betook herself to dances and feasts;
      yet she did this in so seemly a fashion that her husband could not take it
      ill, for she was always in the company of women in whom he had trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, when she was at a wedding, there was also present a Prince of
      very high degree, who, when telling me the story, forbade me to discover
      his name. I may, however, tell you that he was the handsomest and most
      graceful Prince that has ever been or, in my opinion, ever will be in this
      realm. (2)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     2  Francis L, prior to his accession.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      The Prince, seeing this fair and youthful lady whose eyes and countenance
      invited him to love her, came and spoke to her with such eloquence and
      grace that she was well pleased with his discourse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor did she seek to hide from him that she had long had in her heart the
      love for which he prayed, but entreated that he would spare all pains to
      persuade her to a thing to which love, at first sight, had brought her to
      consent. Having, by the artlessness of love, so promptly gained what was
      well worth the pains of being won by time, the young Prince thanked God
      for His favour, and forthwith contrived matters so well that they agreed
      together in devising a means for seeing each other in private.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young Prince failed not to appear at the time and place that had been
      agreed upon, and, that he might not injure his lady&rsquo;s honour, he went in
      disguise. On account, however, of the evil fellows (3) who were wont to
      prowl at night through the city, and to whom he cared not to make himself
      known, he took with him certain gentlemen in whom he trusted.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     3  The French expression here is <i>mauvais garsons</i>, a name
     generally given to foot-pads at that time, but applied more
     particularly to a large band of brigands who, in the
     confusion prevailing during Francis I.&lsquo;s captivity in Spain,
     began to infest the woods and forests around Paris, whence
     at night-time they descended upon the city. Several
     engagements were fought between them and the troops of the
     Queen-Regent, and although their leader, called King
     Guillot, was captured and hanged, the remnants of the band
     continued their depredations for several years.&mdash;B. J.
</pre>
    <p>
      And on entering the street in which the lady lived, he parted from them,
      saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you hear no noise within a quarter of an hour, go home again, and come
      back here for me at about three or four o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They did as they were commanded, and, hearing no noise, withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young Prince went straight to his advocate&rsquo;s house, where he found the
      door open as had been promised him. But as he was ascending the staircase
      he met the husband, carrying a candle in his hand, and was perceived by
      him before he was aware. However Love, who provides wit and boldness to
      contend with the difficulties that he creates, prompted the young Prince
      to go straight up to him and say&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Master advocate, you know the trust which I and all belonging to my house
      have ever put in you, and how I reckon you among my best and truest
      servants. I have now thought it well to visit you here in private, both to
      commend my affairs to you, and also to beg you to give me something to
      drink, for I am in great thirst. And, I pray you, tell none that I have
      come here, for from this place I must go to another where I would not be
      known.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The worthy advocate was well pleased at the honour which the Prince paid
      him in coming thus privately to his house, and, leading him to his own
      room, he bade his wife prepare a collation of the best fruits and
      confections that she had.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the garments she wore, a kerchief and mantle, made her appear
      more beautiful than ever, the young Prince affected not to look at her or
      notice her, but spoke unceasingly to her husband about his affairs, as to
      one who had long had them in his hands. And, whilst the lady was kneeling
      with the confections before the Prince, and her husband was gone to the
      sideboard in order to serve him with drink, she told him that on leaving
      the room he must not fail to enter a closet which he would find on the
      right hand, and whither she would very soon come to see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as he had drunk, he thanked the advocate, who was all eagerness to
      attend him; but the Prince assured him that in the place whither he was
      going he had no need of attendance, and thereupon turning to the wife, he
      said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Moreover, I will not do so ill as to deprive you of your excellent
      husband, who is also an old servant of mine. Well may you render thanks to
      God since you are so fortunate as to have such a husband, well may you
      render him service and obedience. If you did otherwise, you would be
      blameworthy indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these virtuous words the young Prince went away, and, closing the
      door behind him so that he might not be followed to the staircase, he
      entered the closet, whither also came the fair lady as soon as her husband
      had fallen asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thence she led the Prince into a cabinet as choicely furnished as might
      be, though in truth there were no fairer figures in it than he and she, no
      matter what garments they may have been pleased to wear. And here, I doubt
      not, she kept word with him as to all that she had promised.
    </p>
    <p>
      He departed thence at the hour which he had appointed with his gentlemen,
      and found them at the spot where he had aforetime bidden them wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      As this intercourse lasted a fairly long time, the young Prince chose a
      shorter way to the advocate&rsquo;s house, and this led him through a monastery
      of monks. (4) And so well did he contrive matters with the Prior, that the
      porter used always to open the gate for him about midnight, and do the
      like also when he returned. And, as the house which he visited was hard
      by, he used to take nobody with him.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     4  If at this period Jane Disome, the heroine of the story,
     lived in the Rue de la Pauheminerie, where she is known to
     have died some years afterwards, this monastery, in Baron
     Jerome Pichon&rsquo;s opinion, would be the Blancs-Manteaux, in
     the Marais district of Paris. We may further point out that
     in the Rue Barbette, near by, there was till modern times a
     house traditionally known as the &ldquo;hôtel de la belle
     Féronnière.&rdquo; That many writers have confused the heroine of
     this tale with La Belle Féronnière (so called because her
     husband was a certain Le Féron, an advocate) seems manifest;
     the intrigue in which the former took part was doubtless
     ascribed in error to the latter, and the proximity of their
     abodes may have led to the mistake. It should be pointed
     out, however, that the amour here recorded by Queen Margaret
     took place in or about the year 1515, before Francis I.
     ascended the throne, whereas La Féronnière was in all her
     beauty between 1530 and 1540. The tradition that the King
     had an intrigue with La Féronnière reposes on the flimsiest
     evidence (see Appendix B), and the supposition, re-echoed by
     the Bibliophile Jacob, that it was carried on in the Rue de
     l&rsquo;Hirondelle, is entirely erroneous. The house, adorned with
     the salamander device and corneted initials of Francis I.,
     which formerly extended from that street to the Rue Git-le-
     Coeur, never had any connection with La Féronnière. It was
     the famous so-called Palace of Love which the King built for
     his acknowledged mistress, Anne de Pisseleu, Duchess of
     Étampes.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      Although he led the life that I have described, he was nevertheless a
      Prince that feared and loved God, and although he made no pause when
      going, he never failed on his return to continue for a long time praying
      in the church. And the monks, who when going to and fro at the hour of
      matins used to see him there on his knees, were thereby led to consider
      him the holiest man alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Prince had a sister (5) who often visited this monastery, and as she
      loved her brother more than any other living being, she used to commend
      him to the prayers of all whom she knew to be good.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     5  This of course is Queen Margaret, then Duchess of
     Alençon. On account of her apparent intimacy with the prior,
     M. de Montaiglon conjectures that the monastery may have
     been that of St. Martin-in-the-Fields.&mdash;See ante, Tale
     XXII.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      One day, when she was in this manner commending him lovingly to the Prior
      of the monastery, the Prior said to her&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, madam, whom are you thus commending to me? You are speaking to me of
      a man in whose prayers, above those of all others, I would myself fain be
      remembered. For if he be not a holy man and a just&rdquo;&mdash;here he quoted
      the passage which says, &ldquo;Blessed is he that can do evil and doeth it not&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;<i>I</i>
      cannot hope to be held for such.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sister, wishing to learn what knowledge this worthy father could have
      of her brother&rsquo;s goodness, questioned him so pressingly that he at last
      told her the secret under the seal of the confessional, saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it not an admirable thing to see a young and handsome Prince forsake
      pleasure and repose in order to come so often to hear our matins? Nor
      comes he like a Prince seeking honour of men, but quite alone, like a
      simple monk, and hides himself in one of our chapels. Truly such piety so
      shames both the monks and me, that we do not deem ourselves worthy of
      being called men of religion in comparison with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the sister heard these words she was at a loss what to think. She
      knew that, although her brother was worldly enough, he had a tender
      conscience, as well as great faith and love towards God; but she had never
      suspected him of a leaning towards any superstitions or rites save such as
      a good Christian should observe. (6) She therefore went to him and told
      him the good opinion that the monks had of him, whereat he could not hold
      from laughing, and in such a manner that she, knowing him as she did her
      own heart, perceived that there was something hidden beneath his devotion;
      whereupon she rested not until she had made him tell her the truth.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     6  In Boaistuau&rsquo;s edition this sentence ends, &ldquo;But she had
     never suspected him of going to church at such an hour as
     this.&rdquo;&mdash;L.
</pre>
    <p>
      And she has made me here set it down in writing, for the purpose, ladies,
      of showing you that there is no lawyer so crafty and no monk so shrewd,
      but love, in case of need, gives the power of tricking them both, to those
      whose sole experience is in truly loving. And since love can thus deceive
      the deceivers, well may we, who are simple and ignorant folk, stand in awe
      of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Although,&rdquo; said Geburon, &ldquo;I can pretty well guess who the young Prince
      is, I must say that in this matter he was worthy of praise. We meet with
      few great lords who reck aught of a woman&rsquo;s honour or a public scandal, if
      only they have their pleasure; nay, they are often well pleased to have
      men believe something that is even worse than the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;I could wish that all young lords would follow his
      example, for the scandal is often worse than the sin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Nomerfide, &ldquo;the prayers he offered up at the monastery
      through which he passed were sincere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not a matter for you to judge,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;for perhaps his
      repentance on his return was great enough to procure him the pardon of his
      sin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis a hard matter,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;to repent of an offence so pleasing.
      For my own part I have many a time confessed such a one, but seldom have I
      repented of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be better,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;not to confess at all, if one do not
      sincerely repent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, madam,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;sin sorely displeases me, and I am grieved to
      offend God, but, for all that, such sin is ever a pleasure to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You and those like you,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;would fain have neither God
      nor law other than your own desires might set up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will own to you,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;that I would gladly have God take as
      deep a pleasure in my pleasures as I do myself, for I should then often
      give Him occasion to rejoice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However, you cannot set up a new God,&rdquo; said Geburon, &ldquo;and so we must e&rsquo;en
      obey the one we have. Let us therefore leave such disputes to theologians,
      and allow Longarine to give some one her vote.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I give it,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to Saffredent, but I will beg him to tell us the
      finest tale he can think of, and not to be so intent on speaking evil of
      women as to hide the truth when there is something good of them to
      relate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In sooth,&rdquo; said Saffredent, &ldquo;I consent, for I have here in hand the story
      of a wanton woman and a discreet one, and you shall take example by her
      who pleases you best. You will see that just as love leads wicked people
      to do wicked things, so does it lead a virtuous heart to do things that
      are worthy of praise; for love in itself is good, although the evil that
      is in those that are subject to it often makes it take a new title, such
      as wanton, light, cruel or vile. However, you will see from the tale that
      I am now about to relate that love does not change the heart, but
      discovers it to be what it really is, wanton in the wanton and discreet in
      the discreet.&rdquo;

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>By the counsel and sisterly affection of a virtuous lady,
     the Lord of Avannes was drawn from the wanton love that he
     entertained for a gentlewoman dwelling at Pampeluna</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      In the days of King Louis the Twelfth there lived a young lord called
      Monsieur d&rsquo;Avannes, (1) son of the Lord of Albret [and] brother to King
      John of Navarre, with whom this aforesaid Lord of Avannes commonly abode.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  This is Gabriel d&rsquo;Albret, Lord of Avesnes and Lesparre,
     fourth son of Alan the Great, Sire d&rsquo;Albret, and brother of
     John d&rsquo;Albret, King of Navarre, respecting whom see <i>post</i>,
     note 4 to Tale XXX. Queen Margaret is in error in dating
     this story from the reign of Louis XII. The incidents she
     relates must have occurred between 1485 and 1490, under the
     reign of Charles VIII., by whom Gabriel d&rsquo;Albret, on
     reaching manhood, was successively appointed counsellor and
     chamberlain, Seneschal of Guyenne and Viceroy of Naples.
     Under Louis XII. he took a prominent part in the Italian
     campaigns of 1500-1503, in which latter year he is known to
     have made his will, bequeathing all he possessed to his
     brother, Cardinal d&rsquo;Albret. He died a bachelor in 1504.&mdash;See
     Anselme&rsquo;s <i>Histoire Généalogique</i>, vol. vi. p. 214.&mdash;L. and
     Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      Now this young lord, who was fifteen years of age, was so handsome and so
      fully endowed with every excellent grace that he seemed to have been made
      solely to be loved and admired, as he was indeed by all who saw him, and
      above all by a lady who dwelt in the town of Pampeluna (2) in Navarre. She
      was married to a very rich man, with whom she lived in all virtue,
      inasmuch that, although her husband was nearly fifty years old and she was
      only three and twenty, she dressed so plainly that she had more the
      appearance of a widow than of a married woman. Moreover, she was never
      known to go to weddings or feasts unless accompanied by her husband, whose
      worth and virtue she prized so highly that she set them before all the
      comeliness of other men. And her husband, finding her so discreet, trusted
      her and gave all the affairs of his household into her hands.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     2  Pampeluna or Pamplona, the capital of Navarre, wrested
     from King John in 1512 by the troops of Ferdinand the
     Catholic.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      One day this rich man was invited with his wife to a wedding among their
      kinsfolk; and among those who were present to do honour to the bridal was
      the young Lord of Avannes, who was exceedingly fond of dancing, as was
      natural in one who surpassed therein all others of his time. When dinner
      was over and the dances were begun, the rich man begged the Lord of
      Avannes to do his part, whereupon the said lord asked him with whom he
      would have him dance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; replied the gentleman, &ldquo;I can present to you no lady fairer and
      more completely at my disposal than my wife, and I therefore beg you to
      honour me so far as to lead her out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This the young Prince did; and he was still so young that he took far
      greater pleasure in frisking and dancing than in observing the beauty of
      the ladies. But his partner, on the contrary, gave more heed to his grace
      and beauty than to the dance, though in her prudence she took good care
      not to let this appear.
    </p>
    <p>
      The supper hour being come, the Lord of Avannes bade the company farewell,
      and departed to the castle, (3) whither the rich man accompanied him on
      his mule. And as they were going, the rich man said to him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord, you have this day done so much honour to my kinsfolk and to me,
      that I should indeed be ungrateful if I did not place myself with all that
      belongs to me at your service. I know, sir, that lords like yourself, who
      have stern and miserly fathers, are often in greater need of money than
      we, who, with small establishments and careful husbandry, seek only to
      save up wealth. Now, albeit God has given me a wife after my own heart, it
      has not pleased Him to give me all my Paradise in this world, for He has
      withheld from me the joy that fathers derive from having children. I know,
      my lord, that it is not for me to adopt you as a son, but if you will
      accept me for your servant and make known to me your little affairs, I
      will not fail to assist you in your need so far as a hundred thousand
      crowns may go.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     3  Evidently the castle of Pampeluna, where Gabriel d&rsquo;Albret
     resided with his brother the King.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      The Lord of Avannes was in great joy at this offer, for he had just such a
      father as the other had described; accordingly he thanked him, and called
      him his adopted father.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that hour the rich man evinced so much love towards the Lord of
      Avannes, that morning and evening he failed not to inquire whether he had
      need of anything, nor did he conceal this devotion from his wife, who
      loved him for it twice as much as before. Thenceforward the Lord of
      Avannes had no lack of anything that he desired. He often visited the rich
      man, and ate and drank with him; and when he found the husband abroad, the
      wife gave him all that he required, and further spoke to him so sagely,
      exhorting him to live discreetly and virtuously, that he reverenced and
      loved her above all other women.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having God and honour before her eyes, she remained content with thus
      seeing him and speaking to him, for these are sufficient for virtuous and
      honourable love; and she never gave any token whereby he might have
      imagined that she felt aught but a sisterly and Christian affection
      towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this secret love continued, the Lord of Avannes, who, by the
      assistance that I have spoken of, was always well and splendidly
      apparelled, came to the age of seventeen years, and began to frequent the
      company of ladies more than had been his wont. And although he would fain
      have loved this virtuous lady rather than any other, yet his fear of
      losing her friendship should she hear any such discourse from him, led him
      to remain silent and to divert himself elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      He therefore addressed himself to a gentlewoman of the neighbourhood of
      Pampeluna, who had a house in the town, and was married to a young man
      whose chief delight was in horses, hawks and hounds. For her sake, he
      began to set on foot a thousand diversions, such as tourneys, races,
      wrestlings, masquerades, banquets, and other pastimes, at all of which
      this young lady was present. But as her husband was very humorsome, and
      her parents, knowing her to be both fair and frolicsome, were jealous of
      her honour, they kept such strict watch over her that my Lord of Avannes
      could obtain nothing from her save a word or two at the dance, although,
      from the little that had passed between them, he well knew that time and
      place alone were wanting to crown their loves.
    </p>
    <p>
      He therefore went to his good father, the rich man, and told him that he
      deeply desired to make a pilgrimage to our Lady of Montferrat, (4) for
      which reason he begged him to house his followers, seeing that he wished
      to go alone.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     4  The famous monastery of Montserrate, at eight leagues
     from Barcelona, where is preserved the ebony statue of the
     Virgin carrying the Infant Jesus, which is traditionally
     said to have been carved by St. Luke, and to have been
     brought to Spain by St. Peter.&mdash;See <i>Libro de la historia y
     milagros hechos à invocation de Nuestra Seilora de
     Montserrate</i>, Barcelona, 1556, 8vo.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      To this the rich man agreed; but his wife, in whose heart was that great
      soothsayer, Love, forthwith suspected the true nature of the journey, and
      could not refrain from saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord, my lord, the Lady you adore is not without the walls of this
      town, so I pray that you will have in all matters a care for your health.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this he, who both feared and loved her, blushed so deeply that, without
      speaking a word, he confessed the truth; and so he went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having bought a couple of handsome Spanish horses, he dressed himself as a
      groom, and disguised his face in such a manner that none could know him.
      The gentleman who was husband to the wanton lady, and who loved horses
      more than aught beside, saw the two that the Lord of Avannes was leading,
      and forthwith offered to buy them. When he had done so, he looked at the
      groom, who was managing the horses excellently well, and asked whether he
      would enter his service. The Lord of Avannes replied that he would; saying
      that he was but a poor groom, who knew no trade except the caring of
      horses, but in this he could do so well that he would assuredly give
      satisfaction. At this the gentleman was pleased, and having given him the
      charge of all his horses, entered his house, and told his wife that he was
      leaving for the castle, and confided his horses and groom to her keeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady, as much to please her husband as for her own diversion, went to
      see the horses, and looked at the new groom, who seemed to her to be well
      favoured, though she did not at all recognise him. Seeing that he was not
      recognised, he came up to do her reverence in the Spanish fashion and
      kissed her hand, and, in doing so, pressed it so closely that she at once
      knew him, for he had often done the same at the dance. From that moment,
      the lady thought of nothing but how she might speak to him in private; and
      contrived to do so that very evening, for, being invited to a banquet, to
      which her husband wished to take her, she pretended that she was ill and
      unable to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      The husband, being unwilling to disappoint his friends, thereupon said to
      her&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since you will not come, my love, I pray you take good care of my horses
      and hounds, so that they may want for nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lady deemed this charge a very agreeable one, but, without showing it,
      she replied that since he had nothing better for her to do, she would show
      him even in these trifling matters how much she desired to please him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And scarcely was her husband outside the door than she went down to the
      stable, where she found that something was amiss, and to set it right gave
      so many orders to the serving-men on this side and the other, that at last
      she was left alone with the chief groom, when, fearing that some one might
      come upon them, she said to him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go into the garden, and wait for me in a summer house that stands at the
      end of the alley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This he did, and with such speed that he stayed not even to thank her.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had set the whole stable in order, she went to see the dogs, and
      was so careful to have them properly treated, that from mistress she
      seemed to have become a serving-woman. Afterwards she withdrew to her own
      apartment, where she lay down weariedly upon the bed, saying that she
      wished to rest. All her women left her excepting one whom she trusted, and
      to whom she said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go into the garden, and bring here the man whom you will find at the end
      of the alley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The maid went and found the groom, whom she forthwith brought to the lady,
      and the latter then sent her outside to watch for her husband&rsquo;s return.
      When the Lord of Avannes found himself alone with the lady, he doffed his
      groom&rsquo;s dress, took off his false nose and beard, and, not like a timorous
      groom, but like the handsome lord he was, boldly got into bed with her
      without so much as asking her leave; and he was received as the handsomest
      youth of his time deserved to be by the handsomest and gayest lady in the
      land, and remained with her until her husband returned. Then he again took
      his mask and left the place which his craft and artifice had usurped.
    </p>
    <p>
      On entering the courtyard the gentleman heard of the diligence that his
      wife had shown in obeying him, and he thanked her heartily for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sweetheart,&rdquo; said the lady, &ldquo;I did but my duty. Tis true that if we did
      not keep watch upon these rogues of servants you would not have a dog
      without the mange or a horse in good condition; but, now that I know their
      slothfulness and your wishes, you shall be better served than ever you
      were before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman, who thought that he had chosen the best groom in the world,
      asked her what she thought of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will own, sir,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;that he does his work as well as any you
      could have chosen, but he needs to be urged on, for he is the sleepiest
      knave I ever saw.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So the lord and his lady lived together more lovingly than before, and he
      lost all the suspicion and jealousy with which he had regarded her, seeing
      that she was now as careful of her house hold as she had formerly been
      devoted to banquets, dances and assemblies. Whereas, also, she had
      formerly been wont to spend four hours in attiring herself, she was now
      often content to wear nothing but a dressing-gown over her chemise; and
      for this she was praised by her husband and by every one else, for they
      did not understand that a stronger devil had entered her and thrust out a
      weaker one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus did this young lady, under the guise of a virtuous woman, like the
      hypocrite she was, live in such wantonness that reason, conscience, order
      and moderation found no place within her. The youth and tender
      constitution of the Lord of Avannes could not long endure this, and he
      began to grow so pale and lean that even without his mask he might well
      have passed unrecognised; yet the mad love that he had for this woman so
      blunted his understanding that he imagined he had strength to accomplish
      feats that even Hercules had tried in vain. However, being at last
      constrained by sickness and advised thereto by his lady, who was not so
      fond of him sick as sound, he asked his master&rsquo;s leave to return home, and
      this his master gave him with much regret, making him promise to come back
      to service when he was well again.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this wise did the Lord of Avannes go away, and all on foot, for he had
      only the length of a street to travel. On arriving at the house of his
      good father, the rich man, he there found only his wife, whose honourable
      love for him had been in no whit lessened by his journey. But when she saw
      him so colourless and thin, she could not refrain from saying to him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know, my lord, how your conscience may be, but your body has
      certainly not been bettered by your pilgrimage. I fear me that your
      journeyings by night have done you more harm than your journeyings by day,
      for had you gone to Jerusalem on foot you would have come back more
      sunburnt, indeed, but not so thin and weak. Pay good heed to this one, and
      worship no longer such images as those, which, instead of reviving the
      dead, cause the living to die. I would say more, but if your body has
      sinned it has been well punished, and I feel too much pity for you to add
      any further distress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When my Lord of Avannes heard these words, he was as sorry as he was
      ashamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I have heard that repentance follows upon sin, and
      now I have proved it to my cost. But I pray you pardon my youth, which
      could not have been punished save by the evil in which it would not
      believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon changing her discourse, the lady made him lie down in a handsome
      bed, where he remained for a fortnight, taking nothing but restoratives;
      and the lady and her husband constantly kept him company, so that he
      always had one or the other beside him. And although he had acted
      foolishly, as you have heard, contrary to the desire and counsel of the
      virtuous lady, she, nevertheless, lost nought of the virtuous love that
      she felt towards him, for she still hoped that, after spending his early
      youth in follies, he would throw them off and bring himself to love
      virtuously, and so be all her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the fortnight that he was in her house, she held to him such
      excellent discourse, all tending to the love of virtue, that he began to
      loathe the folly that he had committed. Observing, moreover, the lady&rsquo;s
      beauty, which surpassed that of the wanton one, and becoming more and more
      aware of the graces and virtues that were in her, he one day, when it was
      rather dark, could not longer hold from speaking, but, putting away all
      fear, said to her&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see no better means, madam, for becoming a virtuous man such as you
      urge me and desire me to be, than by being heart and soul in love with
      virtue. I therefore pray you, madam, to tell me whether you will give me
      in this matter all the assistance and favour that you can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lady rejoiced to find him speaking in this way, and replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promise you, my lord, that if you are in love with virtue as it beseems
      a lord like yourself to be, I will assist your efforts with all the
      strength that God has given me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, madam,&rdquo; said my Lord of Avannes, &ldquo;remember your promise, and
      consider also that God, whom man knows by faith alone, deigned to take a
      fleshly nature like that of the sinner upon Himself, in order that, by
      drawing our flesh to the love of His humanity, He might at the same time
      draw our spirits to the love of His divinity, thus making use of visible
      means to make us in all faith love the things which are invisible. In like
      manner this virtue, which I would fain love all my life long, is a thing
      invisible except in so far as it produces outward effects, for which
      reason it must take some bodily shape in order to become known among men.
      And this it has done by clothing itself in your form, the most perfect it
      could find. I therefore recognise and own that you are not only virtuous
      but virtue itself; and now, finding it shine beneath the veil of the most
      perfect person that was ever known, I would fain serve it and honour it
      all my life, renouncing for its sake every other vain and vicious love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lady, who was no less pleased than surprised to hear these words,
      concealed her happiness and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord, I will not undertake to answer your theology, but since I am
      more ready to apprehend evil than to believe in good, I will entreat you
      to address to me no more such words as lead you to esteem but lightly
      those who are wont to believe them. I very well know that I am a woman
      like any other and imperfect, and that virtue would do a greater thing by
      transforming me into itself than by assuming my form&mdash;unless, indeed,
      it would fain pass unrecognised through the world, for in such a garb as
      mine its real nature could never be known. Nevertheless, my lord, with all
      my imperfections, I have ever borne to you all such affection as is right
      and possible in a woman who reverences God and her honour. But this
      affection shall not be declared until your heart is capable of that
      patience which a virtuous love enjoins. At that time, my lord, I shall
      know what to say, but meanwhile be assured that you do not love your own
      welfare, person and honour as I myself love them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Lord of Avannes timorously and with tears in his eyes entreated her
      earnestly to seal her words with a kiss, but she refused, saying that she
      would not break for him the custom of her country.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this discussion was going on the husband came in, and my Lord of
      Avannes said to him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am greatly indebted, father, both to you and to your wife, and I pray
      you ever to look upon me as your son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This the worthy man readily promised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to seal your love,&rdquo; said the Lord of Avannes, &ldquo;I pray you let me kiss
      you.&rdquo; This he did, after which the Lord of Avannes said&mdash;:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I were not afraid of offending against the law, I would do the same to
      your wife and my mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upon this, the husband commanded his wife to kiss him, which she did
      without appearing either to like or to dislike what her husband commanded
      her. But the fire that words had already kindled in the poor lord&rsquo;s heart,
      grew fiercer at this kiss which had been so earnestly sought for and so
      cruelly denied.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this the Lord of Avannes betook himself to the castle to see his
      brother, the King, to whom he told fine stories about his journey to
      Montferrat. He found that the King was going to Oly and Taffares, (5) and,
      reflecting that the journey would be a long one, he fell into deep
      sadness, and resolved before going away to try whether the virtuous lady
      were not better disposed towards him than she appeared to be.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     5  Evidently Olite and Tafalla, the former at thirty and the
     latter at twenty-seven miles from Pamplona. The two towns
     were commonly called <i>la flor de Navarra</i>. King John
     doubtless intended sojourning at the summer palaces which
     his predecessor Carlos the Noble had built at either
     locality, and which were connected, it is said, by a gallery
     a league in length. Some ruins of these palaces still exist.

      He therefore went to lodge in the street in which she lived, where he
      hired an old house, badly built of timber. About midnight he set fire to
      it, and the alarm, which spread through the whole town, reached the rich
      man&rsquo;s house. He asked from the window where the fire was, and hearing that
      it was in the house of the Lord of Avannes, immediately hastened thither
      with all his servants. He found the young lord in the street, clad in
      nothing but his shirt, whereat in his deep compassion he took him in his
      arms, and, covering him with his own robe, brought him home as quickly as
      possible, where he said to his wife, who was in bed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, sweetheart, I give this prisoner into your charge. Treat him as you
      would treat myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As soon as he was gone, the Lord of Avannes, who would gladly have been
      treated like a husband, sprang lightly into the bed, hoping that place and
      opportunity would bring this discreet lady to a different mind; but he
      found the contrary to be the case, for as he leaped into the bed on one
      side, she got out at the other. Then, putting on her dressing-gown, she
      came up to the head of the bed and spoke as follows&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you think, my lord, that opportunity could influence a chaste heart?
      Nay, just as gold is tried in the furnace, so a chaste heart becomes
      stronger and more virtuous in the midst of temptation, and grows colder
      the more it is assailed by its opposite. You may be sure, therefore, that
      had I been otherwise minded than I professed myself to be, I should not
      have wanted means, to which I have paid no heed solely because I desire
      not to use them. So I beg of you, if you would have me preserve my
      affection for you, put away not merely the desire but even the thought
      that you can by any means whatever make me other than I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While she was speaking, her women came in, and she commanded a collation
      of all kinds of sweetmeats to be brought; but the young lord could neither
      eat nor drink, in such despair was he at having failed in his enterprise,
      and in such fear lest this manifestation of his passion should cost him
      the familiar intercourse that he had been wont to have with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having dealt with the fire, the husband came back again, and begged the
      Lord of Avannes to remain at his house for the night. This he did, but in
      such wise that his eyes were more exercised in weeping than in sleeping.
      Early in the morning he went to bid them farewell, while they were still
      in bed; and in kissing the lady he perceived that she felt more pity for
      the offence than anger against the offender, and thus was another brand
      added to the fire of his love. After dinner, he set out for Taffares with
      the King; but before leaving he went again to take yet another farewell of
      his good father and the lady who, after her husband&rsquo;s first command, made
      no difficulty in kissing him as her son.
    </p>
    <p>
      But you may be sure that the more virtue prevented her eyes and features
      from testifying to the hidden flame, the fiercer and more intolerable did
      that flame become. And so, being unable to endure the war between love and
      honour, which was waging in her heart, but which she had nevertheless
      resolved should never be made apparent, and no longer having the comfort
      of seeing and speaking to him for whose sake alone she cared to live, she
      fell at last into a continuous fever, caused by a melancholic humour which
      so wrought upon her that the extremities of her body became quite cold,
      while her inward parts burned without ceasing. The doctors, who have not
      the health of men in their power, began to grow very doubtful concerning
      her recovery, by reason of an obstruction that affected the extremities,
      and advised her husband to admonish her to think of her conscience and
      remember that she was in God&rsquo;s hands&mdash;as though indeed the healthy
      were not in them also.
    </p>
    <p>
      The husband, who loved his wife devotedly, was so saddened by their words
      that for his comfort he wrote to the Lord of Avannes entreating him to
      take the trouble to come and see them, in the hope that the sight of him
      might be of advantage to the patient. On receiving the letter, the Lord of
      Avannes did not tarry, but started off post-haste to the house of his
      worthy father, where he found the servants, both men and women, assembled
      at the door, making such lament for their mistress as she deserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      So greatly amazed was he at the sight, that he remained on the threshold
      like one paralysed, until he beheld his good father, who embraced him,
      weeping the while so bitterly that he could not utter a word. Then he led
      the Lord of Avannes to the chamber of the sick lady, who, turning her
      languid eyes upon him, put out her hand and drew him to her with all the
      strength she had. She kissed and embraced him, and made wondrous
      lamentation, saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O my lord, the hour has come when all dissimulation must cease, and I
      must confess the truth which I have been at such pains to hide from you.
      If your affection for me was great, know that mine for you has been no
      less; but my grief has been greater than yours, because I have had the
      anguish of concealing it contrary to the wish of my heart. God and my
      honour have never, my lord, suffered me to make it known to you, lest I
      should increase in you that which I sought to diminish; but you must learn
      that the &lsquo;no&rsquo; I so often said to you pained me so greatly in the utterance
      that it has indeed proved the cause of my death.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless, I am glad it should be so, and that God in His grace should
      have caused me to die before the vehemence of my love has stained my
      conscience and my fair fame; for smaller fires have ere now destroyed
      greater and stronger structures. And I am glad that before dying I have
      been able to make known to you that my affection is equal to your own,
      save only that men&rsquo;s honour and women&rsquo;s are not the same thing. And I pray
      you, my lord, fear not henceforward to address yourself to the greatest
      and most virtuous of ladies; for in such hearts do the deepest and
      discreetest passions dwell, and moreover, your own grace and beauty and
      worth will not suffer your love to toil without reward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not beg you, my lord, to pray God for me, because I know full well
      that the gate of Paradise is never closed against true lovers, and that
      the fire of love punishes lovers so severely in this life here that they
      are forgiven the sharp torment of Purgatory. And now, my lord, farewell; I
      commend to you your good father, my husband. Tell him the truth as you
      have heard it from me, that he may know how I have loved God and him. And
      come no more before my eyes, for I now desire to think only of obtaining
      those promises made to me by God before the creation of the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words she kissed him and embraced him with all the strength of
      her feeble arms. The young lord, whose heart was as nearly dead through
      pity as hers was through pain, was unable to say a single word. He
      withdrew from her sight to a bed that was in the room, and there several
      times swooned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the lady called her husband, and, after giving him much virtuous
      counsel, commended the Lord of Avannes to him, declaring that next to
      himself she had loved him more than any one upon earth, and so, kissing
      her husband, she bade him farewell. Then, after the extreme unction, the
      Holy Sacrament was brought to her from the altar, and this she received
      with the joy of one who is assured of her salvation. And finding that her
      sight was growing dim and her strength failing her, she began to utter the
      &ldquo;In manus&rdquo; aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hearing this cry, the Lord of Avannes raised himself up on the bed where
      he was lying, and gazing piteously upon her, beheld her with a gentle sigh
      surrender her glorious soul to Him from whom it had come. When he
      perceived that she was dead, he ran to the body, which when alive he had
      ever approached with fear, and kissed and embraced it in such wise that he
      could hardly be separated from it, whereat the husband was greatly
      astonished, for he had never believed he bore her so much affection; and
      with the words, &ldquo;Tis too much, my lord,&rdquo; he led him away.
    </p>
    <p>
      After he had lamented for a great while, the Lord of Avannes related all
      the converse they had had together during their love, and how, until her
      death, she had never given him sign of aught save severity. This, while it
      gave the husband exceeding joy, also increased his grief and sorrow at the
      loss he had sustained, and for the remainder of his days he rendered
      service to the Lord of Avannes.
    </p>
    <p>
      But from that time forward my Lord of Avannes, who was then only eighteen
      years old, went to reside at Court, where he lived for many years without
      wishing to see or to speak with any living woman by reason of his grief
      for the lady he had lost; and he wore mourning for her sake during more
      than ten years. (6)
    </p>

     6  Some extracts from Brantôme bearing on this story will be
     found in the Appendix, C.

    <p>
      &ldquo;You here see, ladies, what a difference there is between a wanton lady
      and a discreet one. The effects of love are also different in each case;
      for the one came by a glorious and praiseworthy death, while the other
      lived only too long with the reputation of a vile and shameless woman.
      Just as the death of a saint is precious in the sight of God, so is the
      death of a sinner abhorrent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In truth, Saffredent,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;you have told us the finest tale
      imaginable, and any one who knew the hero would deem it better still. I
      have never seen a handsomer or more graceful gentleman than was this Lord
      of Avannes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was indeed a very virtuous woman,&rdquo; said Saffredent. &ldquo;So as to appear
      outwardly more virtuous than she was in her heart, and to conceal her love
      for this worthy lord which reason and nature had inspired, she must needs
      die rather than take the pleasure which she secretly desired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she had felt such a desire,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;she would have lacked
      neither place nor opportunity to make it known; but the greatness of her
      virtue prevented her desire from exceeding the bounds of reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may paint her as you will,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;but I know very well that a
      stronger devil always thrusts out the weaker, and that the pride of ladies
      seeks pleasure rather than the fear and love of God. Their robes are long
      and well woven with dissimulation, so that we cannot tell what is beneath,
      for if their honour were not more easily stained than ours, (7) you would
      find that Nature&rsquo;s work is as complete in them as in ourselves. But not
      daring to take the pleasure they desire, they have exchanged that vice for
      a greater, which they deem more honourable, I mean a self-sufficient
      cruelty, whereby they look to obtain everlasting renown.

      &ldquo;I am very glad,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;to have a wife of good repute, just as I,
      myself, would be of good repute. But as for chastity of heart, I believe
      that we are both children of Adam and Eve; wherefore, when we examine
      ourselves, we have no need to cover our nakedness with leaves, but should

      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;that we all have need of God&rsquo;s grace, being

      bodies and hands receive a stain. But your pleasure consists in

      <i>TALE XXVII</i>.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>A secretary sought the wife of his host and comrade in
     dishonourable and unlawful love, and as she made show of
     willingly giving ear to him, he was persuaded that he had
     won her. But she was virtuous, and, while dissembling
     towards him, deceived his hopes and made known his
     viciousness to her husband</i>. (1)

     1  The incidents here related would have occurred at Amboise
     between 1540 and 1545. The hero of the story would probably
     be John Frotté, Queen Margaret&rsquo;s First Secretary, who also
     apparently figures in Tale XXVIII. The Sires de Frotté had
     been in the service of the Dukes of Alençon since the early
     part of the fifteenth century. Ste-Marthe says of John
     Frotté that he was a man of great experience and good wit,
     prudent, dutiful and diligent. He died secretary to Francis
     I.&mdash;L. and B. J.
</pre>
    <p>
      In the town of Amboise there lived one of this Princess&rsquo;s servants, an
      honest man who served her in the quality of valet-de-chambre, and who used
      readily to entertain those that visited his house, more especially his own
      comrades; and not long since one of his mistress&rsquo;s servants came to lodge
      with him, and remained with him ten or twelve days.
    </p>
    <p>
      This man was so ugly that he looked more like a King of the cannibals than
      a Christian, and although his host treated him as a friend and a brother,
      and with all the courtesy imaginable, he behaved in return not only like
      one who has forgotten all honour, but as one who has never had it in his
      heart. For he sought, in dishonourable and unlawful love, his comrade&rsquo;s
      wife, who was in no sort attractive to lust but rather the reverse, and
      was moreover as virtuous a woman as any in the town in which she lived.
      When she perceived the man&rsquo;s evil intent, she thought it better to employ
      dissimulation in order to bring his viciousness to light, rather than
      conceal it by a sudden refusal; and she therefore made a pretence of
      approving his discourse. He then believed he had won her, and, paying no
      heed to her age, which was that of fifty years, or to her lack of beauty,
      or her reputation as a virtuous woman attached to her husband, he urged
      his suit continually.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, the husband being in the house, the wife and her suitor were in a
      large room together, when she pretended that he had but to find some safe
      spot in order to have such private converse with her as he desired. He
      immediately replied that it was only necessary to go up to the garret. She
      instantly rose, and begged him to go first, saying that she would follow.
      Smiling with as sweet a countenance as that of a big baboon entertaining a
      friend, he went lightly up the stairway; and, on the tip-toe of
      expectation with regard to that which he so greatly desired, burning with
      a fire not clear, like that of juniper, but dense like that of coal in the
      furnace, he listened whether she was coming after him. But instead of
      hearing her footsteps, he heard her voice saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait, master secretary, for a little; I am going to find out whether it
      be my husband&rsquo;s pleasure that I should go up to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His face when laughing was ugly indeed, and you may imagine, ladies, how
      it looked when he wept; but he came down instantly, with tears in his
      eyes, and besought her for the love of God not to say aught that would
      destroy the friendship between his comrade and himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;that you like him too well to say anything he
      may not hear. I shall therefore go and tell him of the matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And this, in spite of all his entreaties and threats, she did. And if his
      shame thereat was great as he fled the place, the husband&rsquo;s joy was no
      less on hearing of the honourable deception that his wife had practised;
      indeed, so pleased was he with his wife&rsquo;s virtue that he took no notice of
      his comrade&rsquo;s viciousness, deeming him sufficiently punished inasmuch as
      the shame he had thought to work in another&rsquo;s household had fallen upon
      his own head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that from this tale honest people should learn not to admit to
      their houses those whose conscience, heart and understanding know nought
      of God, honour and true love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Though your tale be short,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;it is as pleasant as any I
      have heard, and it is to the honour of a virtuous woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Fore God,&rdquo; said Simontault, &ldquo;it is no great honour for a virtuous woman
      to refuse a man so ugly as you represent this secretary to have been. Had
      he been handsome and polite, her virtue would then have been clear. I
      think I know who he is, and, if it were my turn, I could tell you another
      story about him that is no less droll.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let that be no hindrance,&rdquo; said Ennasuite, &ldquo;for I give you my vote.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon Simontault began as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those who are accustomed to dwell at Court or in large towns value their
      own knowledge so highly that they think very little of all other men in
      comparison with themselves; but, for all that, there are subtle and crafty
      folk to be found in every condition of life. Still, when those who think
      themselves the cleverest are caught tripping, their pride makes the jest a
      particularly pleasant one, and this I will try to show by telling you of
      something that lately happened.&rdquo;

      <i>TALE XXVIII</i>.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>A secretary, thinking to deceive Bernard du Ha, was by him
     cunningly deceived</i>. (1)

     1  The incidents of this story must have occurred subsequent
     to 1527. The secretary is doubtless John Frotté. We have
     failed to identify the Lieutenant referred to.&mdash;M. and Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      It chanced that when King Francis, first of the name, was in the city of
      Paris, and with him his sister, the Queen of Navarre, the latter had a
      secretary called John. He was not one of those who allow a good thing to
      lie on the ground for want of picking it up, and there was, accordingly,
      not a president or a councillor whom he did not know, and not a merchant
      or a rich man with whom he had not intercourse and correspondence.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this time there also arrived in Paris a merchant of Bayonne, called
      Bernard du Ha, who, both on account of the nature of his commerce and
      because the Lieutenant for Criminal Affairs (2) was a countryman of his,
      was wont to address himself to that officer for counsel and assistance in
      the transaction of his business. The Queen of Navarre&rsquo;s secretary used
      also frequently to visit the Lieutenant as one who was a good servant to
      his master and mistress.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     2  The Provost of Paris, who, in the King&rsquo;s name,
     administered justice at the Châtelet court, and upon whose
     sergeants fell the duty of arresting and imprisoning all
     vagabonds, criminals and disturbers of the peace, was
     assisted in his functions by three lieutenants, one for
     criminal affairs, one for civil affairs, and one for
     ordinary police duties.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      One feast-day the secretary went to the Lieutenant&rsquo;s house, and found both
      him and his wife abroad; but he very plainly heard Bernard du Ha teaching
      the serving-women to foot the Gascon dances to the sound of a viol or some
      other instrument. And when the secretary saw him, he would have had him
      believe that he was committing the greatest offence imaginable, and that
      if the Lieutenant and his wife knew of it they would be greatly displeased
      with him. And after setting the fear of this well before his eyes, until,
      indeed, the other begged him not to say anything about it, he asked&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will you give me if I keep silence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bernard du Ha, who was by no means so much afraid as he seemed to be, saw
      that the secretary was trying to cozen him, and promised to give him a
      pasty of the best Basque ham (3) that he had ever eaten. The secretary was
      well pleased at this, and begged that he might have the pasty on the
      following Sunday after dinner, which was promised him.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     3  So-called Bayonne ham is still held in repute in France.
     It comes really from Orthez and Salies in Beam.&mdash;D.
</pre>
    <p>
      Relying upon this promise, he went to see a lady of Paris whom above all
      things he desired to marry, and said to her&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On Sunday, mistress, I will come and sup with you, if such be your
      pleasure. But trouble not to provide aught save some good bread and wine,
      for I have so deceived a foolish fellow from Bayonne that all the rest
      will be at his expense; by my trickery you shall taste the best Basque ham
      that ever was eaten in Paris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lady believed his story, and called together two or three of the most
      honourable ladies of her neighbourhood, telling them that she would give
      them a new dish such as they had never tasted before.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Sunday was come, the secretary went to look for his merchant, and
      finding him on the Pont-au-Change, (4) saluted him graciously and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil take you, for the trouble you have given me to find you.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     4  The oldest of the Paris bridges, spanning the Seine
     between the Châtelet and the Palais. Originally called the
     Grand-Pont, it acquired the name of Pont-au-Change through
     Louis VII. allowing the money-changers to build their houses
     and offices upon it in 1141.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      Bernard du Ha made reply that a good many men had taken more trouble than
      he without being rewarded in the end with such a dainty dish. So saying,
      he showed him the pasty, which he was carrying under his cloak, and which
      was big enough to feed an army. The secretary was so glad to see it that,
      although he had a very large and ugly mouth, he mincingly made it so small
      that one would not have thought him capable of biting the ham with it. He
      quickly took the pasty, and, without waiting for the merchant to go with
      him, went off with it to the lady, who was exceedingly eager to learn
      whether the fare of Gascony was as good as that of Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      When supper-time was come and they were eating their soup, the secretary
      said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave those savourless dishes alone, and let us taste this loveworthy
      whet for wine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he opened the huge pasty, but, where he expected to find ham,
      he found such hardness that he could not thrust in his knife. After trying
      several times, it occurred to him that he had been deceived; and, indeed,
      he found &lsquo;twas a wooden shoe such as is worn in Gascony. It had a burnt
      stick for knuckle, and was powdered upon the top with iron rust and
      sweet-smelling spice.
    </p>
    <p>
      If ever a man was abashed it was the secretary, not only because he had
      been deceived by the man whom he himself had thought to deceive, but also
      because he had deceived her to whom he had intended and thought to speak
      the truth. Moreover, he was much put out at having to content himself with
      soup for supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ladies, who were well-nigh as vexed as he was, would have accused him
      of practising this deception had they not clearly seen by his face that he
      was more wroth than they.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this slight supper, the secretary went away in great anger,
      intending, since Bernard du Ha had broken his promise, to break also his
      own. He therefore betook himself to the Lieutenant&rsquo;s house, resolved to
      say the worst he could about the said Bernard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quick as he went, however, Bernard was first afield and had already
      related the whole story to the Lieutenant, who, in passing sentence, told
      the secretary that he had now learnt to his cost what it was to deceive a
      Gascon, and this was all the comfort that the secretary got in his shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same thing befalls many who, believing that they are exceedingly
      clever, forget themselves in their cleverness; wherefore we should never
      do unto others differently than we would have them do unto us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can assure you,&rdquo; said Geburon, &ldquo;that I have often known similar things
      to come to pass, and have seen men who were deemed rustic blockheads
      deceive very shrewd people. None can be more foolish than he who thinks
      himself shrewd, nor wiser than he who knows his own nothingness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;a man who knows that he knows nothing, knows
      something after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Simontault, &ldquo;for fear lest time should fail us for our
      discourse, I give my vote to Nomerfide, for I am sure that her rhetoric
      will keep us no long while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;I will tell you a tale such as you desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not surprised, ladies, that love should afford Princes the means of
      escaping from danger, for they are bred up in the midst of so many
      well-informed persons that I should marvel still more if they were
      ignorant of anything. But the smaller the intelligence the more clearly is
      the inventiveness of love displayed, and for this reason I will relate to
      you a trick played by a priest through the prompting of love alone. In all
      other matters he was so ignorant that he could scarcely read his mass.&rdquo;

      <i>TALE XXIX</i>.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>A parson, surprised by the sudden return of a husbandman
     with whose wife he was making good cheer, quickly devised a
     means for saving himself at the expense of the worthy man,
     who was never any the wiser</i>. (1)

     1  Etienne brings this story into his <i>Apologie pour
     Hérodote</i>, ch xv.&mdash;B. J.
</pre>
    <p>
      At a village called Carrelles, (2) in the county of Maine, there dwelt a
      rich husbandman who in his old age had married a fair young wife. She bore
      him no children, but consoled herself for this disappointment with several
      lovers.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     2 Carrelles is at six leagues from Mayenne, in the canton of
     Gorron. Margaret&rsquo;s first husband, the Duke of Alençon, held
     various fiefs in this part of Maine, which would account for
     the incident related in the story coming to her knowledge.&mdash;
     M. and Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      When gentlemen and persons of consequence failed her, she turned as a last
      resource to the Church, and took for companion in her sin him who could
      absolve her of it&mdash;that is to say, the parson, who often came to
      visit his pet ewe. The husband, who was dull and old, had no suspicion of
      the truth; but, as he was a stern and sturdy man, his wife played her game
      as secretly as she was able, fearing that, if it came to her husband&rsquo;s
      knowledge, he would kill her.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day when he was abroad, his wife, thinking that he would not soon
      return, sent for his reverence the parson, who came to confess her; and
      while they were making good cheer together, her husband arrived, and this
      so suddenly that the priest had not the time to escape out of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking about for a means of concealment, he mounted by the woman&rsquo;s advice
      into a loft, and covered the trap-door through which he passed with a
      winnowing fan.
    </p>
    <p>
      The husband entered the house, and his wife, fearing lest he might suspect
      something, regaled him exceedingly well at dinner, never sparing the
      liquor, of which he drank so much, that, being moreover wearied with his
      work in the fields, he at last fell asleep in his chair in front of the
      fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parson, tired with waiting so long in the loft, and hearing no noise
      in the room beneath, leaned over the trap-door, and, stretching out his
      neck as far as he was able, perceived the goodman to be asleep. However,
      whilst he was looking at him, he leaned by mischance so heavily upon the
      fan, that both fan and himself tumbled down by the side of the sleeper.
      The latter awoke at the noise, but the priest was on his feet before the
      other had perceived him, and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is your fan, my friend, and many thanks to you for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words he took to flight. The poor husbandman was in utter
      bewilderment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; he asked of his wife. &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis your fan, sweetheart,&rdquo; she
      replied, &ldquo;which the parson had borrowed, and has just brought back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon in a grumbling fashion the goodman rejoined&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis a rude way of returning what one has borrowed, for I thought the
      house was coming down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In this way did the parson save himself at the expense of the goodman, who
      discovered nothing to find fault with except the rudeness with which the
      fan had been returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The master, ladies, whom the parson served, saved him that time so that
      he might afterwards possess and torment him the longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not imagine,&rdquo; said Geburon, &ldquo;that simple folk are more devoid of craft
      than we are; (3) nay, they have a still larger share. Consider the thieves
      and murderers and sorcerers and coiners, and all the people of that sort,
      whose brains are never at rest; they are all poor and of the class of
      artisans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not think it strange,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;that they should have more
      craft than others, but rather that love should torment them amid their
      many toils, and that so gentle a passion should lodge in hearts so base.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; replied Saffredent, &ldquo;you know what Master Jehan de Mehun has said&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Those clad in drugget love no less
     Than those that wear a silken dress.&rdquo; (4)

     3  In MS. No. 1520 this passage runs&mdash;&ldquo;that simple and
     humble people are,&rdquo; &amp;c.&mdash;L.

     4  This is a free rendering of lines 4925-6 of Méon&rsquo;s
     edition of the <i>Roman de la Rose</i>:&mdash;

     &ldquo;Aussy bien sont amourettes
     Soubz bureau que soubz brunettes.&rdquo;

     <i>Bureau</i>, the same as <i>dure</i>, is a kind of drugget;
     <i>brunette</i> was a silken stuff very fashionable among the
     French lords and ladies at the time of St. Louis. It was
     doubtless of a brown hue.&mdash;B, J. and M.
</pre>
    <p>
      Moreover, the love of which the tale speaks is not such as makes one carry
      harness; for, while poor folk lack our possessions and honours, on the
      other hand they have their natural advantages more at their convenience
      than we. Their fare is not so dainty as ours, but their appetites are
      keener, and they live better on coarse bread than we do on delicacies.
      Their beds are not so handsome or so well appointed as ours, but their
      sleep is sounder and their rest less broken. They have no ladies pranked
      out and painted like those whom we idolise, but they take their pleasure
      oftener than we, without fear of telltale tongues, save those of the
      beasts and birds that see them. What we have they lack, and what we lack
      they possess in abundance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pray you,&rdquo; said Nomerfide, &ldquo;let us now have done with this peasant and
      his wife, and let us finish the day&rsquo;s entertainment before vespers. &lsquo;Tis
      Hircan shall bring it to an end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have kept in reserve as strange and pitiful a tale as
      ever you heard. And although it grieves me greatly to relate anything to
      the discredit of a lady, knowing, as I do, that men are malicious enough
      to blame the whole sex for the fault of one, yet the strangeness of the
      story prompts me to lay aside my fear. Perhaps, also, the discovery of one
      woman&rsquo;s ignorance will make others wiser. And so I will fearlessly tell
      you the following tale.&rdquo;

      In the time of King Louis the Twelfth, the Legate at Avignon being then a

      there lived in the land of Languedoc a lady who had an income of more than
      four thousand ducats a year, and whose name I shall not mention for the
      love I bear her kinsfolk.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  This story is based on an ancient popular tradition
     common to many parts of France, and some particulars of
     which, with a list of similar tales in various European
     languages, will be found in the Appendix, D.&mdash;En.

     2  The Papal Legate in France here alluded to is the famous
     George, Cardinal d&rsquo;Amboise, favourite minister of Louis XII.
     His nephew, the Legate at Avignon, is Louis d&rsquo;Amboise,
     fourth son of Peter d&rsquo;Amboise, Lord of Chaumont, and brother
     of the Grand-Master of Chaumont. Louis d&rsquo;Amboise became
     bishop of Albi, and lieutenant-general of the King of France
     in Burgundy, Languedoc and Roussillon, and played an
     important part in the public affairs of his time. He died in
     1505.&mdash;See <i>Gallia Christiana</i>, vol. i. p. 34.&mdash;L. and R. J.
</pre>
    <p>
      While still very young, she was left a widow with one son; and, both by
      reason of her regret for her husband and her love for her child, she
      determined never to marry again. To avoid all opportunity of doing so, she
      had fellowship only with the devout, for she imagined that opportunity
      makes the sin, not knowing that sin will devise the opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      This young widow, then, gave herself up wholly to the service of God, and
      shunned all worldly assemblies so completely that she scrupled to be
      present at a wedding, or even to listen to the organs playing in a church.
      When her son was come to the age of seven years, she chose for his
      schoolmaster a man of holy life, so that he might be trained up in all
      piety and devotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the son was reaching the age of fourteen or fifteen, Nature, who is a
      very secret schoolmaster, finding him in good condition and very idle,
      taught him a different lesson to any he had learned from his tutor. He
      began to look at and desire such things as he deemed beautiful, and among
      others a maiden who slept in his mother&rsquo;s room. No one had any suspicion
      of this, for he was looked upon as a mere child, and, moreover, in that
      household nothing save godly talk was ever heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      This young gallant, however, began secretly soliciting the girl, who
      complained of it to her mistress. The latter had so much love for her son
      and so high an opinion of him, that she thought the girl spoke as she did
      in order to make her hate him; but, being strongly urged by the other, she
      at last said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall find out whether it is true, and will punish him if it be as you
      say. But if, on the other hand, you are bringing an untruthful accusation
      against him, you shall suffer for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, in order to test the matter, she bade the girl make an appointment
      with her son that he might come and lie with her at midnight, in the bed
      in which she slept alone, beside the door of his mother&rsquo;s room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The maid obeyed her mistress, who, when night came, took the girl&rsquo;s place,
      resolved, if the story were true, to punish her son so severely that he
      would never again lie with a woman without remembering it.
    </p>
    <p>
      While she was thinking thus wrathfully, her son came and got into the bed,
      but although she beheld him do so, she could not yet believe that he
      meditated any unworthy deed. She therefore refrained from speaking to him
      until he had given her some token of his evil intent, for no trifling
      matters could persuade her that his desire was actually a criminal one.
      Her patience, however, was tried so long, and her nature proved so frail
      that, forgetting her motherhood, her anger became transformed into an
      abominable delight. And just as water that has been restrained by force
      rushes onward with the greater vehemence when it is released, so was it
      with this unhappy lady who had so prided herself on the constraint she had
      put upon her body. After taking the first step downwards to dishonour, she
      suddenly found herself at the bottom, and thus that night she became
      pregnant by him whom she had thought to restrain from acting in similar
      fashion towards another.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner was the sin accomplished than such remorse of conscience began
      to torment her as filled the whole of her after-life with repentance. And
      so keen was it at the first, that she rose from beside her son&mdash;who
      still thought that she was the maid&mdash;and entered a closet, where,
      dwelling upon the goodness of her intention and the wickedness of its
      execution, she spent the whole night alone in tears and lamentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      But instead of humbling herself, and recognising the powerlessness of our
      flesh, without God&rsquo;s assistance, to work anything but sin, she sought by
      her own tears and efforts to atone for the past, and by her own prudence
      to avoid mischief in the future, always ascribing her sin to circumstances
      and not to wickedness, for which there is no remedy save the grace of God.
      Accordingly she sought to act so as never again to fall into such
      wrongdoing; and as though there were but one sin that brought damnation in
      its train, she put forth all her strength to shun that sin alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the roots of pride, which acts of sin ought rather to destroy, grew
      stronger and stronger within her, so that in avoiding one evil she wrought
      many others. Early on the morrow, as soon as it was light, she sent for
      her son&rsquo;s preceptor, and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My son is beginning to grow up, it is time to send him from home. I have
      a kinsman, Captain Monteson, (3) who is beyond the mountains with my lord
      the Grand-Master of Chaumont, and he will be very glad to admit him into
      his company. Take him, therefore, without delay, and to spare me the pain
      of parting do not let him come to bid me farewell.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     3  Monteson was one of the bravest captains of his time; as
     the comrade of Bayard, he greatly distinguished himself by
     his intrepidity in Louis XII.&lsquo;s Italian campaigns. Some
     particulars concerning him will be found in M. Lacroix&rsquo;s
     edition of <i>Les Chroniques de Jean d&rsquo;Anton</i>.&mdash;B. J.
     Respecting the Grand-Master of Chaumont, also mentioned
     above, see <i>ante</i>, vol ii., notes to Tale XIV.

    <p>
      So saying, she gave him money for the journey, and that very morning sent
      the young man away, he being right glad of this, for, after enjoying his
      sweetheart, he asked nothing better than to set off to the wars.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady continued for a great while in deep sadness and melancholy, and,
      but for the fear of God, had many a time longed that the unhappy fruit of
      her womb might perish. She feigned sickness, in order that she might wear
      a cloak and so conceal her condition; and having a bastard brother, in
      whom she had more trust than in any one else, and upon whom she had
      conferred many benefits, she sent for him when the time of her confinement
      was drawing nigh, told him her condition (but without mentioning her son&rsquo;s
      part in it), and besought him to help her save her honour. This he did,
      and, a few days before the time when she expected to be delivered, he
      begged her to try a change of air and remove to his house, where she would
      recover her health more quickly than at home. Thither she went with but a
      very small following, and found there a midwife who had been summoned as
      for her brother&rsquo;s wife, and who one night, without recognising her,
      delivered her of a fine little girl. The gentleman gave the child to a
      nurse, and caused it to be cared for as his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      After continuing there for a month, the lady returned in sound health to
      her own house, where she lived more austerely than ever in fasts and
      disciplines. But when her son was grown up, he sent to beg his mother&rsquo;s
      permission to return home, as there was at that time no war in Italy. She,
      fearing lest she should fall again into the same misfortune, would not at
      first allow him, but he urged her so earnestly that at last she could find
      no reason for refusing him. However, she instructed him that he was not to
      appear before her until he was married to a woman whom he dearly loved;
      but to whose fortune he need give no heed, for it would suffice if she
      were of gentle birth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile her bastard brother, finding that the daughter left in his
      charge had grown to be a tall maiden of perfect beauty, resolved to place
      her in some distant household where she would not be known, and by the
      mother&rsquo;s advice she was given to Catherine, Queen of Navarre. (4) The
      maiden thus came to the age of twelve or thirteen years, and was so
      beautiful and virtuous that the Queen of Navarre had great friendship for
      her, and much desired to marry her to one of wealth and station. Being
      poor, however, she found no husband, though she had lovers enough and to
      spare.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     4  This is Catherine, daughter of Gaston and sister of
     Francis Phoebus de Foix. On her brother&rsquo;s death, in 1483,
     she became Queen of Navarre, Duchess of Nemours and Countess
     of Foix and Bigorre, and in the following year espoused
     John, eldest son of Alan, Sire d&rsquo;Albret. Catherine at this
     time was fourteen years old, and her husband, who by the
     marriage became King of Navarre, was only one year her
     senior. Their title to the crown was disputed by a dozen
     pretenders, for several years they exercised but a
     precarious authority, and eventually, in July 1512,
     Ferdinand the Catholic despatched the Duke of Alva to
     besiege Pamplona. On the fourth day of the siege John and
     Catherine succeeded in escaping from their capital, which,
     three days later, surrendered. Ferdinand, having sworn to
     maintain the <i>fueros</i>, was thereupon acknowledged as
     sovereign. However, it was only in 1516 that the former
     rulers were expelled from Navarrese territory. &ldquo;Had I been
     Don Juan and you Donna Catherine,&rdquo; said the Queen to her
     pusillanimous husband, as they crossed the Pyrenees, &ldquo;we
     should not have lost our kingdom.&rdquo; From this time forward
     the d&rsquo;Albrets, like their successors the Bourbons, were
     sovereigns of Navarre in name only, for an attempt made in
     1521 to reconquer the kingdom resulted in total failure, and
     their dominions were thenceforth confined to Beam, Bigorre,
     and Foix on the French side of the Pyrenees. Queen Catherine
     died in 1517, aged 47, leaving several children, the eldest
     of whom was Henry, Queen Margaret&rsquo;s second husband.&mdash;M., B.
     J., D. and Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      Now it happened one day that the gentleman who was her unknown father came
      to the house of the Queen of Navarre on his way back from beyond the
      mountains, and as soon as he had set eyes on his daughter he fell in love
      with her, and having license from his mother to marry any woman that might
      please him, he only inquired whether she was of gentle birth, and, hearing
      that she was, asked her of the Queen in marriage. The Queen willingly
      consented, for she knew that the gentleman was not only rich and handsome,
      but worshipful to boot.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the marriage had been consummated, the gentleman again wrote to his
      mother, saying that she could no longer close her doors against him, since
      he was bringing with him as fair a daughter-in-law as she could desire.
      The lady inquired to whom he had allied himself, and found that it was to
      none other than their own daughter. Thereupon she fell into such exceeding
      sorrow that she nearly came by a sudden death, seeing that the more she
      had striven to hinder her misfortune, the greater had it thereby become.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not knowing what else to do, she went to the Legate of Avignon, to whom
      she confessed the enormity of her sin, at the same time asking his counsel
      as to how she ought to act. The Legate, to satisfy his conscience, sent
      for several doctors of theology, and laid the matter before them, without,
      however, mentioning any names; and their advice was that the lady should
      say nothing to her children, for they, being in ignorance, had committed
      no sin, but that she herself should continue doing penance all her life
      without allowing it to become known.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, the unhappy lady returned home, where not long afterwards her
      son and daughter-in-law arrived. And they loved each other so much that
      never were there husband and wife more loving, nor yet more resembling
      each other; for she was his daughter, his sister and his wife, while he
      was her father, her brother and her husband. And this exceeding love
      between them continued always; and the unhappy and deeply penitent lady
      could never see them in dalliance together without going apart to weep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, ladies, what befalls those who think that by their own strength
      and virtue they may subdue Love and Nature and all the faculties that God
      has given them. It were better to recognise their own weakness, and
      instead of running a-tilt against such an adversary, to betake themselves
      to Him who is their true Friend, saying to Him in the words of the
      Psalmist, &lsquo;Lord, I am afflicted very much; answer Thou for me.&rsquo;&rdquo; (5)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     5  We have failed to find this sentence in the Psalms.
     Probably the reference is to <i>Isaiah</i> xxxviii. 14, &ldquo;O Lord,
     I am oppressed; undertake for me.&rdquo;&mdash;Eu.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It were impossible,&rdquo; said Oisille &ldquo;to hear a stranger story than this.
      Methinks every man and woman should bend low in the fear of God, seeing
      that in spite of a good intention so much mischief came to pass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may be sure,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;that the first step a man takes in
      self-reliance, removes him so far from reliance upon God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man is wise,&rdquo; said Geburon, &ldquo;when he knows himself to be his greatest
      enemy, and holds his own wishes and counsels in suspicion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Albeit the motive might seem to be a good and holy one,&rdquo; said Longarine,
      &ldquo;there were surely none, howsoever worthy in appearance, that should
      induce a woman to lie beside a man, whatever the kinship between them, for
      fire and tow may not safely come together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without question,&rdquo; said Ennasuite, &ldquo;she must have been some
      self-sufficient fool, who, in her friar-like dreaming, deemed herself so
      saintly as to be incapable of sin, just as many of the Friars would have
      us believe that we can become, merely by our own efforts, which is an
      exceeding great error.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it possible, Longarine,&rdquo; asked Oisille, &ldquo;that there are people foolish
      enough to hold such an opinion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They go further than that,&rdquo; replied Longarine. &ldquo;They say that we ought to
      accustom ourselves to the virtue of chastity; and in order to try their
      strength they speak with the prettiest women they can find and whom they
      like best, and by kissing and touching them essay whether their fleshly
      nature be wholly dead. When they find themselves stirred by such pleasure,
      they desist, and have recourse to fasts and grievous discipline. Then,
      when they have so far mortified their flesh that neither speech nor kiss
      has power to move them, they make trial of the supreme temptation, that,
      namely, of lying together and embracing without any lustfulness. (6) But
      for one who has escaped, so many have come to mischief, that the
      Archbishop of Milan, where this religious practice used to be carried on,
      (7) was obliged to separate them and place the women in convents and the
      men in monasteries.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     6  Robert d&rsquo;Arbrissel, the founder of the abbey of
     Fontevrault (see ante, p. 74), was accused of this
     practice.&mdash;See the article Fontevraud in Desoer&rsquo;s edition of
     Bayle&rsquo;s Dictionary, vi. 508, 519.&mdash;M.

     7  Queen Margaret possibly refers to some incidents which
     occurred at Milan in the early part of the fourteenth
     century, when Matteo and Galeazzo Visconti ruled the city.
     In Signor Tullio Dandolo&rsquo;s work, <i>Sui xxiii. libri delta
     Histories Patrice di Giuseppe Ripamonti ragionamento</i>
     (Milano, 1856, pp. 52-60), will be found the story of a
     woman of the people, Guglielmina, and her accomplice, Andrea
     Saramita, who under some religious pretext founded a secret
     society of females. The debauchery practised by its members
     being discovered, Saramita was burnt alive, and
     Guglielmina&rsquo;s bones were disinterred and thrown into the
     fire. The Bishop of Milan at this time (1296-1308) was
     Francesco Fontana.&mdash;M.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; said Geburon, &ldquo;it were the extremity of folly to seek to become
      sinless by one&rsquo;s own efforts, and at the same time to seek out
      opportunities for sin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are some,&rdquo; said Saffredent, &ldquo;who do the very opposite, and flee
      opportunities for sin as carefully as they are able; nevertheless,
      concupiscence pursues them. Thus the good Saint Jerome, after scourging
      and hiding himself in the desert, confessed that he could not escape from
      the fire that consumed his marrow. We ought, therefore, to recommend
      ourselves to God, for unless He uphold us by His power, we are greatly
      prone to fall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not notice what I do,&rdquo; said Hircan. &ldquo;While we were telling our
      stories, the monks behind the hedge here heard nothing of the vesper-bell;
      whereas, now that we have begun to speak about God, they have taken
      themselves off, and are at this moment ringing the second bell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall do well to follow them,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;and praise God for
      enabling us to spend this day in the happiest manner imaginable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hereat they rose and went to the church, where they piously heard vespers;
      after which they went to supper, discussing the discourses they had heard,
      and calling to mind divers adventures that had come to pass in their own
      day, in order to determine which of them were worthy to be recounted. And
      after spending the whole evening in gladness, they betook themselves to
      their gentle rest, hoping on the morrow to continue this pastime which was
      so agreeable to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so was the Third Day brought to an end.

      A. (Tale XX., Page 21.)
    </h2>
    <p>
      Brantôme alludes as follows to this tale, in the Fourth Discourse of his
      <i>Vies des Dames Galantes</i>:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew a great lady whose plumpness was the subject of general talk both
      whilst she was a maid and when she became a wife, but she happened to lose
      her husband, and gave way to such extreme grief that she became as dry as
      a stick. Still she did not cease to enjoy herself to her heart&rsquo;s content,
      with the assistance of one of her secretaries, and even so it is said of
      her cook. Nevertheless, she did not regain her plumpness, albeit the said
      cook, who was all grease and fat, should as it seems to me have made her
      stout again. Whilst she thus amused herself with one and another of her
      varlets, she affected more prudery and chastity than any other lady of the
      Court, having none but words of virtue on her lips, speaking ill of all
      other women and finding something to be censured in each of them. Very
      similar to this one was that great lady of Dauphiné who is mentioned in
      the Hundred Tales of the Queen of Navarre, and who was found, lying on the
      grass with her stableman or muleteer, by a gentleman who was in love with
      her to distraction. On finding her thus, however, he was speedily cured of
      his love-sickness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have read in an old romance about John de Saintré, printed in
      black-letter, that the late King John brought him up as a page. In the old
      times it was usual for great personages to send their pages about with
      messages, as is indeed done nowadays, but at that time they journeyed
      anywhere across country, on horseback. In fact, I have heard our fathers
      say that pages were often sent on little embassies, for very often a
      matter would be settled and expense saved by merely despatching a page
      with a horse and a piece of silver. This little Jehan de Saintré, as he
      was long called, was a great favourite with his master King John, for he
      was full of wit, and it often happened that he was sent with messages to
      his [the King&rsquo;s?] sister, who was then a widow, though of whom the book
      does not say. This lady fell in love with him after several messages that
      he had delivered to her, and one day finding him alone, she engaged him in
      converse, and, according to the usual practice of ladies when they wish to
      engage any one in a love attack, she began to ask him if he were in love
      with any lady of the Court, and which one pleased him the most. This
      little John de Saintre, who had never even so much as thought of love,
      told her that he cared for none at the Court as yet, whereupon she
      mentioned several other ladies to him, and asked him whether he thought of
      them. &lsquo;Still less,&rsquo; replied he.... Thereupon the lady, seeing that the
      young fellow was of good appearance, told him that she would give him a
      mistress who would love him tenderly if he would serve her well, and
      whilst he stood there feeling greatly ashamed, she made him promise that
      he would keep the matter secret, and finally declared to him that she
      herself wished to be his lady and lover, for at that time the word
      &lsquo;mistress&rsquo; was not yet used. The young page was vastly astonished,
      thinking that the lady was joking, or wished to deceive him or to have him
      whipped. However, she soon showed him so many signs of the fire and fever
      of love, saying to him that she wished to tutor him and make a man of him,
      that he at last realised that it was not a jest. Their love lasted for a
      long time, both whilst he was a page and afterwards, until at length he
      had to go upon a long journey, when she replaced him by a big, fat abbot.
      This is the same story that one finds in the <i>Nouvelles du Monde
      Advantureux</i> by a valet of the Queen of Navarre [Antoine de St. Denis],
      in which one sees the abbot insult this same John de Saintré who was so
      brave and valiant, and who right speedily and liberally paid back my lord
      the abbot in his own coin.... So you see it is no new thing for ladies to
      love pages. What inclinations some women have, they will willingly take
      any number of lovers but they want no husband! All this is through love of
      liberty, which they deem such a pleasant thing. It seems to them as though
      they were in Paradise when they are not under a husband&rsquo;s rule. They have
      a fine dowry and spend it thriftily, they have all their household affairs
      in hand, receive their income, everything passing through their hands; and
      instead of being servants they are mistresses, select their own pleasures
      and favourites, and amuse themselves as much as they like.&rdquo;&mdash;Lalanne&rsquo;s
      <i>OEuvres de Brantôme</i>, vol. xi. pp. 703-6.

    <p>
      Baron Jerome Pichon&rsquo;s elucidations of this story, as given by him in the
      <i>Mélanges de la Société des Bibliophiles Français</i>, 1866, may be thus
      summarised:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The advocate referred to in the tale is James Disome, who Mézeray declares
      was the <i>first</i> to introduce Letters to the bar, though this, to my
      mind, is a very hazardous assertion. Disome was twice married. His first
      wife, Mary de Rueil, died Sept. 17, 1511, and was buried at the Cordeliers
      church; he afterwards espoused Jane Lecoq, daughter of John Lecoq,
      Counsellor of the Paris Parliament, who held the fiefs of Goupillières,
      Corbeville and Les Porcherons, where he possessed a handsome château, a
      view of which has been engraved by Israel Silvestre. John Lecoq&rsquo;s wife was
      Magdalen Bochart, who belonged like her husband to an illustrious family
      of lawyers and judges. Their daughter Jane, who is the heroine of the
      tale, must have been married to James Disome not very long after the death
      of the latter&rsquo;s first wife, for her intrigue with Francis I. originated
      prior to his accession to the throne (1515). This is proved by the tale,
      in which Disome is spoken of as being the young prince&rsquo;s advocate. Now
      none but the Procurors and Advocates-General were counsel to the Crown,
      and Disome held neither of those offices. He was undoubtedly advocate to
      Francis as Duke de Valois, and, from certain allusions in the tale, it may
      be conjectured that he had been advocate to Francis&rsquo;s father, the Count of
      Angoulême.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Francis ascended the throne his intrigue with Jane Disome was already
      notorious, as is proved by this extract, under date 1515, from the <i>Journal
      d&rsquo;un Bourgeois de Paris</i>: &ldquo;About this time whilst the King was in
      Paris, there was a priest called Mons. Cruche, a great buffoon, who a
      little time before with several others had publicly performed in certain
      entertainments and novelties&rsquo; (<i>sic</i>) on scaffolds upon the Place
      Maubert, there being in turn jest, sermon, morality and farce; and in the
      morality appeared several lords taking their cloth of gold to the tomb and
      carrying their lands upon their shoulders into the other world. And in the
      farce came Monsieur Cruche with his companions, who had a lantern by which
      all sorts of things were seen, and among others a hen feeding under a
      salamander, (1) and this hen carried something on her back which would
      suffice to kill ten men (<i>dix hommes, i.e.</i>, Disome).
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  The salamander was Francis I.&lsquo;s device.
</pre>
    <p>
      The interpretation of this was that the King loved and enjoyed a woman of
      Paris, who was the daughter of a counsellor of the Court of Parliament,
      named Monsieur le Coq. And she was married to an advocate at the bar of
      Parliament, a very skilful man, named Monsieur James Disome, who was
      possessed of much property which the King confiscated. Soon afterwards the
      King sent eight or ten of his principal gentlemen to sup at the sign of
      the Castle in the Rue de la Juiverie, and thither, under the false
      pretence of making him play the said farce, was summoned Messire Cruche,
      who came in the evening, by torch-light, and was constrained to play the
      farce by the said gentlemen. But thereupon, at the very beginning, he was
      stripped to his shirt, and wonderfully well whipped with straps until he
      was in a state of the utmost wretchedness. At the end there was a sack all
      ready to put him in, that he might be thrown from the window, and then
      carried to the river; and this would assuredly have come to pass had not
      the poor man cried out very loudly and shown them the tonsure on his head.
      And all these things were done, so it was owned, on the King&rsquo;s behalf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is probable that this intrigue between the King and Jane Disome ceased
      soon after the former&rsquo;s accession; at all events Francis did not evince
      much indulgence for the man whose wife he had seduced. Under date April,
      1518, the Journal dun Bourgeois de Paris mentions the arrest of several
      advocates and others for daring to discuss the question of the Pragmatic
      Sanction. Disome was implicated in the matter but appears to have escaped
      for a time; however in September of that year we find him detained at
      Orleans and subjected to the interrogatories of various royal
      Commissioners. The affair was then adjourned till the following year, when
      no further mention is made of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Disome died prior to 1521, for in September of that year we find his wife
      remarried to Peter Perdrier, Lord of Baubigny, notary and secretary to the
      King, and subsequently clerk of the council to the city of Paris. Perdrier
      was a man of considerable means; for when the King raised a forced loan of
      silver plate in September 1521, we find him taxed to the amount of forty
      marcs of silver (26 1/2 lbs. troy); or only ten <i>marcs</i> less than
      each counsellor of Parliament was required to contribute. Five and twenty
      years later, he lost his wife Jane, the curious record of whose death runs
      as follows: &ldquo;The year one thousand five hundred forty-six, after Easter,
      at her house (hôtel) Rue de la Parcheminerie, called Rue des
      Blancs-Manteaux, died the late Demoiselle Jane Lecoq, daughter of Master
      John Lecoq, Counsellor of the Court of Parliament, deceased; in her
      lifetime wife of noble Master Peter Perdrier, Lord of Baubigny, &amp;c,
      and previously wife of the late Master James Disome, in his lifetime
      advocate at the Court of Parliament and Lord of Cernay in Beauvaisis; and
      the said Demoiselle Jane Lecoq (2) is here&mdash;buried with her father
      and mother, and departed this life on the 23rd day of April 1546. Pray ye
      God for her soul.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <p>
      Less than a twelvemonth afterwards King Francis followed his whilom
      mistress to the tomb. She left by Peter Perdrier a son named John, Lord of
      Baubigny, who in 1558 married Anne de St. Simon, grand-aunt of the author
      of the Memoirs. John Perdrier was possibly the Baubigny who killed Marshal
      de St. André at the battle of Dreux in 1562.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such is Baron Pichon&rsquo;s account of Jane Lecoq and her husbands. We have now
      to turn to an often-quoted passage of the <i>Diverses Leçons</i> of Louis
      Guyon, sieur de la Nauthe, a physician of some repute in his time, but
      whose book it should be observed was not issued till 1610, or more than
      half-a-century subsequent to King Francis I.&lsquo;s death. La Nauthe writes as
      follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Francis I. became enamoured of a woman of great beauty and grace, the
      wife of an advocate of Paris, whom I will not name, for he has left
      children in possession of high estate and good repute; and this lady would
      not yield to the King, but on the contrary repulsed him with many harsh
      words, whereat the King was sorely vexed. And certain courtiers and royal
      princes who knew of the matter told the King that he might take her
      authoritatively and by virtue of his royalty, and one of them even went
      and told this to the lady, who repeated it to her husband. The advocate
      clearly perceived that he and his wife must needs quit the kingdom, and
      that he would indeed find it hard to escape without obeying. Finally the
      husband gave his wife leave to comply with the King&rsquo;s desire, and in order
      that he might be no hindrance in the matter, he pretended to have business
      in the country for eight or ten days; during which time, however, he
      remained concealed in Paris, frequenting the brothels and trying to
      contract a venereal disease in order to give it to his wife, so that the
      King might catch it from her; and he speedily found what he sought, and
      infected his wife and she the King, who gave it to several other women,
      whom he kept, and could never get thoroughly cured, for all the rest of
      his life he remained unhealthy, sad, peevish and inaccessible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brantôme, it may be mentioned, also speaks of the King contracting a
      complaint through his gallantries, and declares that it shortened his
      life, but he mentions no woman by name, and does not tell the story of the
      advocate&rsquo;s wife. It will have been observed in the extract we have quoted
      that Guyon de la Nauthe says that the advocate had left children &ldquo;in
      possession of high estate and good repute.&rdquo; Disome, however, had no
      children either by his first or his second wife. The question therefore
      arises whether La Nauthe is not referring to another advocate, for
      instance Le Féron, husband of La belle Féronnière. These would appear to
      have left posterity (see <i>Catalogue de tous les Conseillers du Parlement
      de Paris</i>, pp. 120-2-3, and Blanchard&rsquo;s <i>les Présidents à mortier du
      Parlement de Paris, etc</i>., 1647, 8vo). But it should be borne in mind
      that the Féronnière intrigue is purely traditional. The modern writers who
      speak of it content themselves with referring to Mézeray, a very doubtful
      authority at most times, and who did not write, it should be remembered,
      till the middle of the seventeenth century, his <i>Abrégé Chronologique</i>
      being first published in 1667. Moreover, when we come to consult him we
      find that he merely makes a passing allusion to La Féronnière, and even
      this is of the most dubious kind. Here are his words: &ldquo;In 1538 the King
      had a long illness at Compiègne, caused by an ulcer.... He was cured at
      the time, but died [of it?] nine years later. <i>I have sometimes heard
      say</i>(!) that he caught this disease from La belle Féronnière.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Against this we have to set the express statement of Louise of Savoy, who
      writes in her journal, under date 1512, that her son (born in 1494) had
      already and at an early age had a complaint <i>en secrete nature</i>. Now
      this was long before the belle Féronnière was ever heard of, and further
      it was prior to the intrigue with Jane Disome, who, by Queen Margaret&rsquo;s
      showing, did not meet with &ldquo;the young prince&rdquo; until she had been married
      some time and was in despair of having children by her husband. The latter
      had lost his first wife late in 1511, and it is unlikely that he married
      Jane Lecoq until after some months of widowhood. To our thinking Prince
      Francis would have appeared upon the scene in or about 1514, his intrigue
      culminating in the scandal of the following year, in which Mons. Cruche
      played so conspicuous a part. With reference to the complaint from which
      King Francis is alleged to have suffered, one must not overlook the
      statement of a contemporary, Cardinal d&rsquo;Armagnac, who, writing less than a
      year before the King&rsquo;s death, declares that Francis enjoys as good health
      as any man in his kingdom (Genin&rsquo;s <i>Lettres de Marguerite</i>, 1841, p.
      473). Cardinal d&rsquo;Armagnac&rsquo;s intimacy with the King enabled him to speak
      authoritatively, and his statement refutes the assertions of Brantôme,
      Guyon de la Nauthe and Mézeray, besides tending to the conclusion that the
      youthful complaint mentioned by Louise of Savoy was merely a passing
      disorder.&mdash;Ed.

      C. (Tale XXVI., Page 143.)
    </h2>
    <p>
      Brantome mentions this tale in both the First and the Fourth Discourse of
      his <i>Dames Galantes</i>. In the former, after contending that all women
      are naturally inclined to vice&mdash;a view which he borrows from the <i>Roman
      de la Rose</i>, and which Pope afterwards re-echoed in the familiar line,
      &ldquo;Every woman is at heart a rake&rdquo;&mdash;he proceeds to speak of those who
      overcome their inclinations and remain virtuous:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of this,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;we have a very fine story in the Hundred Tales of the
      Queen of Navarre; the one in which that worthy Lady of Pampeluna, vicious
      at heart and by inclination, burning too with love for that handsome
      Prince, Monsieur d&rsquo;Avannes, preferred to die consumed by the fire that
      possessed her rather than seek a remedy for it, as she herself declared in
      her last words on her deathbed. This worshipful and beautiful lady dealt
      herself death most iniquitously and unjustly; and as I once heard a worthy
      man and worthy lady say of this very passage, she did really offend
      against God, since it was in her power to deliver herself from death;
      whereas in seeking it and advancing it as she did, she really killed
      herself. And thus have done many similar to her, who by excessive
      continence and abstinence have brought about the destruction both of their
      souls and bodies.&rdquo;&mdash;Lalanne&rsquo;s <i>OEuvres de Brantôme</i>, vol. ix.
      pp. 209-n.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Fourth Discourse of his work, Brantôme mentions the case of a
      &ldquo;fresh and plump&rdquo; lady of high repute, who, through love-sickness for one
      of her admirers, so wasted away that she became seriously alarmed, and for
      fear of worse resolved to satisfy her passion, whereupon she became &ldquo;plump
      and beautiful as she had been before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard speak,&rdquo; adds Brantôme, &ldquo;of another very great lady, of very
      joyous humour, and great wit, who fell ill and whose doctor told her that
      she would never recover unless she yielded to the dictates of nature,
      whereupon she instantly rejoined: &lsquo;Well then, let it be so;&rsquo; and she and
      the doctor did as they listed.... One day she said to him: &lsquo;It is said
      everywhere that you have relations with me; but that is all the same to
      me, since it keeps me in good health... and it shall continue so, as long
      as may be, since my health depends on it.&rsquo; These two ladies in no wise
      resemble that worthy lady of Pampeluna, in the Queen of Navarre&rsquo;s Hundred
      Tales, who, as I have previously said, fell madly in love with Monsieur
      d&rsquo;Avannes, but preferred to hide her flame and nurse it in her burning
      breast rather than forego her honour. And of this I have heard some worthy
      ladies and lords discourse, saying that she was a fool, caring but little
      for the salvation of her soul, since she dealt herself death, when it was
      in her power to drive death away, at very trifling cost."-Lalanne&rsquo;s <i>OEuvres
      de Brantôme</i>, vol. xi. pp. 542-5.
    </p>
    <p>
      To these extracts we may add that the problem discussed by Brantôme, three
      hundred years ago, is much the same as that which has so largely occupied
      the attention of modern medical men, namely the great spread of nervous
      disease and melancholia among women, owing to the unnatural celibacy
      enforced upon them by the deficiency of husbands.&mdash;Ed.

      D. (Tale XXX., Page 191).
    </h2>
    <p>
      Various French, English and Italian authors have written imitations of
      this tale, concerning which Dunlop writes as follows in his History of
      Fiction:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The plot of Bandello&rsquo;s thirty-fifth story is the same as that of Horace
      Walpole&rsquo;s comedy <i>The Mysterious Mother</i>, and of the Queen of
      Navarre&rsquo;s thirtieth tale. The earlier portion will be found also in
      Masuccio&rsquo;s twenty-third tale: but the second part, relating to the
      marriage, occurs only in Bandello&rsquo;s work and the <i>Heptameron</i>. It is
      not likely, however, that the French or the Italian novelist borrowed from
      one another. The tales of Bandello were first published in 1554, and as
      the Queen of Navarre died in 1549, it is improbable that she ever had an
      opportunity of seeing them. On the other hand, the work of the Queen was
      not printed till 1558, nine years after her death, so it is not likely
      that any part of it was copied by Bandello, whose tales had been edited
      some years before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Walpole, it may be mentioned, denied having had any knowledge either of
      the <i>Heptameron</i> or of Bandello when he wrote <i>The Mysterious
      Mother</i>, which was suggested to him, he declared, by a tale he had
      heard when very young, of a lady who had waited on Archbishop Tillotson
      with a story similar to that which is told by Queen Margaret&rsquo;s heroine to
      the Legate of Avignon. According to Walpole, Tillotson&rsquo;s advice was
      identical with that given by the Legate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dunlop mentions that a tale of this character is given in Byshop&rsquo;s <i>Blossoms</i>
      (vol. xi.); and other authors whose writings contain similar stories are:
      Giovani Brevio, <i>Rime e Prose vulgari</i>, Roma, 1545 (Novella iv.);
      Desfontaine&rsquo;s <i>L&rsquo;Inceste innocent, histoire véritable</i>, Paris, 1644 5
      Tommaso Grappulo, or Grappolino, <i>Il Convito Borghesiano</i>, Londra,
      1800 (Novella vii.); Luther, <i>Colloquia Mens alia</i> (article on
      auricular confession); and Masuccio de Solerac, <i>Novellino</i>, Ginevra,
      1765 (Novella xxiii.).
    </p>
    <p>
      Curiously enough, Bandello declares that the story was related to him by a
      lady of Navarre (Queen Margaret?) as having occurred in that country,
      while Julio de Medrano, a Spanish author of the sixteenth century, asserts
      that it was told to him in the Bourbonnais as being actual fact, and that
      he positively saw the house where the lady&rsquo;s son and his wife resided; but
      on the other hand we find the tale related, in its broad lines, in <i>Amadis
      de Gaule</i> as being an old-time legend, and in proof of this, it figures
      in an ancient French poem of the life of St. Gregory, the MS. of which
      still exists at Tours, and was printed in 1854.
    </p>
    <p>
      In support of the theory that the tale is based on actual fact, the
      following passage from Millin&rsquo;s <i>Antiquités Nationales</i> (vol. iii. f.
      xxviii. p. 6) is quoted&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the middle of the nave of the collégial church of Ecouis, in the cross
      aisle, was found a white marble slab on which was inscribed this epitaph:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Hore lies the child, here lies the father,
     Here lies the sister, here lies the brother,
     Here lie the wife and the husband,
     Yet there are but two bodies here.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The tradition is that a son of Madame d&rsquo;Écouis had by his mother, without
      knowing her or being recognised by her, a daughter named Cecilia, whom he
      afterwards married in Lorraine, she then being in the service of the
      Duchess of Bar. Thus Cecilia was at one and the same time her husband&rsquo;s
      daughter, sister and wife. They were interred together in the same grave
      at Écouis in 1512.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      According to Millin, a similar tradition will be found with variations in
      different parts of France. For instance, at the church of Alincourt, a
      village between Amiens and Abbeville, there was to be seen in Millin&rsquo;s
      time an epitaph running as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Here lies the son, here lies the mother,
     Here lies the daughter with the father;
     Here lies the sister, here lies the brother,
     Here lie the wife and the husband;
     And there are only three bodies here.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Gaspard Meturas, it may be added, gives the same epitaph in his <i>Hortus
      Epitaphiomm Selectorum</i>, issued in 1648, but declares that it is to be
      found at Clermont in Auvergne&mdash;a long way from Amiens&mdash;and
      explains it by saying that the mother engendered her husband by
      intercourse with her own father; whence it follows that he was at the same
      time her husband, son and brother.&mdash;L. M. and Ed.

      PROLOGUE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Lady Oisille, as was her excellent custom, rose up on the morrow very
      much earlier than the others, and meditating upon her book of Holy
      Scripture, awaited the company which, little by little, assembled together
      again. And the more slothful of them excused themselves in the words of
      the Bible, saying, &ldquo;I have a wife, and therefore could not come so
      quickly.&rdquo; (1) In this wise it came to pass that Hircan and his wife
      Parlamente found the reading of the lesson already begun. Oisille,
      however, knew right well how to pick out the passage in the Scriptures,
      which reproves those who neglect the hearing of the Word, and she not only
      read the text, but also addressed to them such excellent and pious
      exhortations that it was impossible to weary of listening to her.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  &ldquo;I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.&rdquo;&mdash;St.
     Luke xiv. 20.&mdash;M.
</pre>
    <p>
      The reading ended, Parlamente said to her&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I felt sorry for my slothfulness when I came in, but since my error has
      led you to speak to me in such excellent fashion, my laziness has profited
      me double, for I have had rest of body by sleeping longer, and
      satisfaction of spirit by hearing your godly discourse.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said
      Oisille, &ldquo;let us for penance go to mass and pray Our Lord to give us both
      will and power to fulfil His commandments; and then may He command us
      according to His own good pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she was saying these words, they reached the church, where they piously
      heard mass. And afterwards they sat down to table, where Hircan failed not
      to laugh at the slothfulness of his wife. After dinner they withdrew to
      rest and study their parts, (2) and when the hour was come, they all found
      themselves at the wonted spot.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     2  Meaning what they had to relate. The French word is
     <i>rolle</i> from <i>rotulus</i>.&mdash;M.
</pre>
    <p>
      Then Oisille asked Hircan to whom he would give his vote to begin the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If my wife,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;had not begun yesterday, I should have given her
      my vote, for although I always thought that she loved me more than any man
      alive, she has further proved to me this morning that she loves me better
      than God or His Word, seeing that she neglected your excellent reading to
      bear me company. However, since I cannot give my vote to the discreetest
      lady of the company, I will present it to Geburon, who is the discreetest
      among the men; and I beg that he will in no wise spare the monks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was not necessary to beg that of me,&rdquo; said Geburon; &ldquo;I was not at all
      likely to forget them. Only a short while ago I heard Monsieur de
      Saint-Vincent, Ambassador of the Emperor, tell a story of them which is
      well worthy of being rememorated and I will now relate it to you.&rdquo;

      <i>TALE XXXI</i>.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>A monastery of Grey Friars was burned down, with the monks
     that were in it, as a perpetual memorial of the cruelty
     practised by one among them that was in love with a lady</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      In the lands subject to the Emperor Maximilian of Austria (1) there was a
      monastery of Grey Friars that was held in high repute, and nigh to it
      stood the house of a gentleman who was so kindly disposed to these monks
      that he could withhold nothing from them, in order to share in the
      benefits of their fastings and disciplines. Among the rest there was a
      tall and handsome friar whom the said gentleman had taken to be his
      confessor, and who had as much authority in the gentleman&rsquo;s house as the
      gentleman himself. This friar, seeing that the gentleman&rsquo;s wife was as
      beautiful and prudent as it was possible to be, fell so deeply in love
      with her that he lost all appetite for both food and drink, and all
      natural reason as well. One day, thinking to work his end, he went all
      alone to the house, and not finding the gentleman within, asked the lady
      whither he was gone. She replied that he was gone to an estate where he
      proposed remaining during two or three days, but that if the friar had
      business with him, she would despatch a man expressly to him. The friar
      said no to this, and began to walk to and fro in the house like one with a
      weighty matter in his mind.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  Maximilian I., grandfather of Charles V. and Ferdinand
     I., and Emperor of Germany from 1494 to 1519.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      When he had left the room, the lady said to one of her women (and there
      were but two) &ldquo;Go after the good father and find out what he wants, for I
      judge by his countenance that he is displeased.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The serving-woman went to the courtyard and asked the friar whether he
      desired aught, whereat he answered that he did, and, drawing her into a
      corner, he took a dagger which he carried in his sleeve, and thrust it
      into her throat. Just after he had done this, there came into the
      courtyard a mounted servant who had been gone to receive the rent of a
      farm. As soon as he had dismounted he saluted the friar, who embraced him,
      and while doing so thrust the dagger into the back part of his neck. And
      thereupon he closed the castle gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady, finding that her serving-woman did not return, was astonished
      that she should remain so long with the friar, and said to the other&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go and see why your fellow-servant does not come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman went, and as soon as the good father saw her, he drew her aside
      into a corner and did to her as he had done to her companion. Then,
      finding himself alone in the house, he came to the lady, and told her that
      he had long been in love with her, and that the hour was now come when she
      must yield him obedience.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady, who had never suspected aught of this, replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure, father, that were I so evilly inclined, you would be the first
      to cast a stone at me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come out into the courtyard,&rdquo; returned the monk, &ldquo;and you will see what I
      have done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When she beheld the two women and the man lying dead, she was so terrified
      that she stood like a statue, without uttering a word. The villain, who
      did not seek merely an hour&rsquo;s delight, would not take her by force, but
      forthwith said to her&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mistress, be not afraid; you are in the hands of him who, of all living
      men, loves you the most.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he took off his long robe, beneath which he wore a shorter one,
      which he gave to the lady, telling her that if she did not take it, she
      should be numbered with those whom she saw lying lifeless before her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      More dead than alive already, the lady resolved to feign obedience, both
      to save her life, and to gain time, as she hoped, for her husband&rsquo;s
      return. At the command of the friar, she set herself to put off her
      head-dress as slowly as she was able; and when this was done, the friar,
      heedless of the beauty of her hair, quickly cut it off. Then he caused her
      to take off all her clothes except her chemise, and dressed her in the
      smaller robe he had worn, he himself resuming the other, which he was wont
      to wear; then he departed thence with all imaginable speed, taking with
      him the little friar he had coveted so long.
    </p>
    <p>
      But God, who pities the innocent in affliction, beheld the tears of this
      unhappy lady, and it so happened that her husband, having arranged matters
      more speedily than he had expected, was now returning home by the same
      road by which she herself was departing. However, when the friar perceived
      him in the distance, he said to the lady&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see your husband coming this way. I know that if you look at him he
      will try to take you out of my hands. Go, then, before me, and turn not
      your head in his direction; for, if you make the faintest sign, my dagger
      will be in your throat before he can deliver you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he was speaking, the gentleman came up, and asked him whence he was
      coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From your house,&rdquo; replied the other, &ldquo;where I left my lady in good
      health, and waiting for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman passed on without observing his wife, but a servant who was
      with him, and who had always been wont to foregather with one of the
      friar&rsquo;s comrades named Brother John, began to call to his mistress,
      thinking, indeed, that she was this Brother John. The poor woman, who
      durst not turn her eyes in the direction of her husband, answered not a
      word. The servant, however, wishing to see her face, crossed the road, and
      the lady, still without making any reply, signed to him with her eyes,
      which were full of tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant then went after his master and said&mdash;&ldquo;Sir, as I crossed
      the road I took note of the friar&rsquo;s companion. He is not Brother John, but
      is very like my lady, your wife, and gave me a pitiful look with eyes full
      of tears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman replied that he was dreaming, and paid no heed to him; but
      the servant persisted, entreating his master to allow him to go back,
      whilst he himself waited on the road, to see if matters were as he
      thought. The gentleman gave him leave, and waited to see what news he
      would bring him. When the friar heard the servant calling out to Brother
      John, he suspected that the lady had been recognised, and with a great,
      iron-bound stick that he carried, he dealt the servant so hard a blow in
      the side that he knocked him off his horse. Then, leaping upon his body,
      he cut his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman, seeing his servant fall in the distance, thought that he
      had met with an accident, and hastened back to assist him. As soon as the
      friar saw him, he struck him also with the iron-bound stick, just as he
      had struck the servant, and, flinging him to the ground, threw himself
      upon him. But the gentleman being strong and powerful, hugged the friar so
      closely that he was unable to do any mischief, and was forced to let his
      dagger fall. The lady picked it up, and, giving it to her husband, held
      the friar with all her strength by the hood. Then her husband dealt the
      friar several blows with the dagger, so that at last he cried for mercy
      and confessed his wickedness. The gentleman was not minded to kill him,
      but begged his wife to go home and fetch their people and a cart, in which
      to carry the friar away. This she did, throwing off her robe, and running
      as far as her house in nothing but her shift, with her cropped hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman&rsquo;s men forthwith hastened to assist their master to bring
      away the wolf that he had captured. And they found this wolf in the road,
      on the ground, where he was seized and bound, and taken to the house of
      the gentleman, who afterwards had him brought before the Emperor&rsquo;s Court
      in Flanders, when he confessed his evil deeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      And by his confession and by proofs procured by commissioners on the spot,
      it was found that a great number of gentlewomen and handsome wenches had
      been brought into the monastery in the same fashion as the friar of my
      story had sought to carry off this lady; and he would have succeeded but
      for the mercy of Our Lord, who ever assists those that put their trust in
      Him. And the said monastery was stripped of its spoils and of the handsome
      maidens that were found within it, and the monks were shut up in the
      building and burned with it, as an everlasting memorial of this crime, by
      which we see that there is nothing more dangerous than love when it is
      founded upon vice, just as there is nothing more gentle or praiseworthy
      when it dwells in a virtuous heart. (2)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     2  Queen Margaret states (<i>ante</i>, p. 5) that this tale was
     told by M. de St.-Vincent, ambassador of Charles V., and
     seems to imply that the incident recorded in it was one of
     recent occurrence. The same story may be found, however, in
     most of the collections of early <i>fabliaux</i>. See <i>OEuvres de
     Rutebeuf</i>, vol. i. p. 260 (<i>Frère Denise</i>), Legrand
     d&rsquo;Aussy&rsquo;s <i>Fabliaux</i>, vol. iv. p. 383, and the <i>Recueil
     complet des Fabliaux</i>, Paris, 1878, vol. iii. p. 253. There
     is also some similarity between this tale and No. LX. of the
     <i>Cent Nouvelles Nouvelles</i>. Estienne quotes it in his
     <i>Apologie pour Hérodote</i>, L&rsquo;Estoile in his <i>Journal du règne
     de Henri III. (anno</i> 1577), Malespini uses it in his
     <i>Ducento Novelle</i> (No. 75), and it suggested to Lafontaine
     his <i>Cordeliers de Catalogne</i>.&mdash;L. and M.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very sorry, ladies, that truth does not provide us with stories as
      much to the credit of the Grey Friars as it does to the contrary. It would
      be a great pleasure to me, by reason of the love that I bear their Order,
      if I knew of one in which I could really praise them; but we have vowed so
      solemnly to speak the truth that, after hearing it from such as are well
      worthy of belief, I cannot but make it known to you. Nevertheless, I
      promise you that, whenever the monks shall accomplish a memorable and
      glorious deed, I will be at greater pains to exalt it than I have been in
      relating the present truthful history.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In good faith, Geburon,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;that was a love which might well
      have been called cruelty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am astonished,&rdquo; said Simontault, &ldquo;that he was patient enough not to
      take her by force when he saw her in her shift, and in a place where he
      might have mastered her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was not an epicure, but a glutton,&rdquo; said Saffredent. &ldquo;He wanted to
      have his fill of her every day, and so was not minded to amuse himself
      with a mere taste.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was not the reason,&rdquo; said Parlamente. &ldquo;Understand that a lustful man
      is always timorous, and the fear that he had of being surprised and robbed
      of his prey led him, wolf-like, to carry off his lamb that he might devour
      it at his ease.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For all that,&rdquo; said Dagoucin, &ldquo;I cannot believe that he loved her, or
      that the virtuous god of love could dwell in so base a heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be that as it may,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;he was well punished, and I pray God
      that like attempts may meet with the same chastisement. But to whom will
      you give your vote?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To you, madam,&rdquo; replied Geburon; &ldquo;you will, I know, not fail to tell us a
      good story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since it is my turn,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;I will relate to you one that is
      indeed excellent, seeing that the adventure befel in my own day, and
      before the eyes of him who told it to me. You are, I am sure, aware that
      death ends all our woes, and this being so, it may be termed our happiness
      and tranquil rest. It is, therefore, a misfortune if a man desires death
      and cannot obtain it, and so the most grievous punishment that can be
      given to a wrongdoer is not death, but a continual torment, great enough
      to render death desirable, but withal too slight to bring it nearer. And
      this was how a husband used his wife, as you shall hear.&rdquo;

      <i>TALE XXXII</i>.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>Bernage, learning in what patience and humility a German
     lady submitted to the strange penance laid upon her for her
     unchastity by her husband, so persuaded the latter that he
     forgot the past, showed pity to his wife, and, taking her
     back again, afterwards had by her some very handsome
     children</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      King Charles, eighth of the name, sent into Germany a gentleman called
      Bernage, Lord of Sivray, near Amboise, (1) who to make good speed spared
      not to travel both by day and night. In this wise he came very late one
      evening to a gentleman&rsquo;s castle, where he asked for lodging, a request
      which was not granted him without great difficulty.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  Bernage, Bernaige, or Vernaiges, as the name is diversely
     written in the MSS. of the <i>Heptameron</i>, was in 1495 equerry
     to Charles VIII., a post which brought him an annual salary
     of 300 livres.&mdash;See Godefroy&rsquo;s <i>Histoire de Charles VIII</i>.,
     p. 705. Civray, near Chenonceaux, on the Cher, was a fief of
     the barony of Amboise. In 1483 we find a certain John
     Goussart doing homage for it to the crown.&mdash;Archives
     Nationales, Section Domaniale, côte 3801.&mdash;L.
</pre>
    <p>
      However, when the gentleman came to know that he was servant to so great a
      King, he went to him and begged him not to take the churlishness of his
      servants in bad part, since he was obliged to keep his house thus closed
      on account of certain of his wife&rsquo;s kinsfolk who sought to do him hurt.
      Bernage then told him the nature of his mission, wherein the gentleman
      offered to serve the interests of the King his master, so far as in him
      lay; and he forthwith led Bernage into the house, where he lodged and
      entertained him honourably.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the hour for supper, and the gentleman led him into a handsome
      room, hung with beautiful tapestry, where, as soon as the meats were
      served, he saw come from behind the hangings the most beautiful woman it
      were possible to behold; though her head was shorn and she was dressed in
      black garments of the German fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the gentleman had washed his hands with Bernage, water was borne to
      the lady, who also washed hers and then sat down at the end of the table
      without speaking to the gentleman, or he to her. The Lord de Bernage
      looked very closely at her, and thought her one of the most beautiful
      women he had ever seen, except that her face was very pale, and its
      expression very sad.
    </p>
    <p>
      After eating a little, she asked for drink, which was brought to her by a
      servant in a most marvellous vessel, for it was a death&rsquo;s head, the
      eyeholes of which were closed with silver; and from this she drank two or
      three times. When she had supped, the lady washed her hands, made a
      reverence to the lord of the house, and retired again behind the tapestry
      without speaking to any one. Bernage was exceedingly amazed at this
      strange sight, and became very melancholy and thoughtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman, who perceived this, then said to him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I perceive that you are astonished at what you have seen at this table;
      but for the sake of the excellence that I find in you I will explain the
      matter, so that you may not think I could show such cruelty without
      reasons of great weight. The lady whom you saw is my wife; I loved her
      more than ever man loved woman, insomuch that in order to marry her I
      forgot all fear, and brought her hither in defiance of her relations. On
      her part, she showed me so many tokens of love that I would have risked
      ten thousand lives in bringing her hither, to her delight and mine. And
      here we lived for a while in such peace and gladness that I deemed myself
      the happiest gentleman in Christendom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it came to pass, upon my undertaking a journey which my honour
      compelled me to make, she forgot her honour, conscience and love for me to
      such a degree as to fall in love with a young gentleman whom I had brought
      up in this house, and this I thought I could perceive when I returned home
      again. Nevertheless, the love I bore her was so great that I was not able
      to mistrust her, until at last experience opened my eyes and made me see
      what I dreaded more than death, whereupon my love for her was turned to
      frenzy and despair in such wise that I watched her closely, and one day,
      while feigning to walk abroad, I hid myself in the room in which she now
      dwells.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thither she withdrew soon after my departure, and sent for the young
      gentleman, whom I saw come in with such familiarity as should have been
      mine alone. But when I saw him about to get upon the bed beside her, I
      sprang out, seized him in her very arms, and slew him. And as my wife&rsquo;s
      crime seemed to me so great that death would not suffice to punish it, I
      laid upon her a penalty which she must hold, I think, to be more bitter
      than death; and this penalty was to shut her up in the room to which she
      was wont to retire to take her greatest pleasures in the company of him
      for whom she had more love than she had for me; and there I further placed
      in a cupboard all her lover&rsquo;s bones, hanging there even as precious things
      are hung up in a cabinet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That she may not lose the memory of this villain I cause her to be served
      with his skull, (2) in place of a cup, when she is eating and drinking at
      table, and this always in my presence, so that she may behold, alive, him
      whom her guilt has made her mortal enemy, and dead, through love of her,
      him whose love she did prefer to mine. And in this wise, at dinner and at
      supper, she sees the two things that must be most displeasing to her, to
      wit, her living enemy, and her dead lover; and all this through her own
      great sinfulness.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     2  It will be remembered that the Lombard King Alboin forced
     his wife Rosamond to drink his health out of a goblet which
     had been made from the skull of her father Cunimond,
     sovereign of the Gepidæ. To revenge herself for this
     affront, Rosamond caused her husband to be murdered one
     night during his sleep in his palace at Pavia.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In other matters I treat her as I do myself, save that she goes shorn;
      for an array of hair beseems not the adulterous, nor a veil the unchaste.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For this reason is her hair cut, showing that she has lost the honour of
      virginity and purity. Should it please you to take the trouble to see her,
      I will lead you to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this Bernage willingly consented, and going-downstairs they found her
      in a very handsome apartment, seated all alone in front of the fire. The
      gentleman drew aside a curtain that hung in front of a large cupboard,
      wherein could be seen hanging a dead man&rsquo;s bones. Bernage greatly longed
      to speak to the lady, but durst not do so for fear of the husband. The
      gentleman, perceiving this, thereupon said to him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it be your pleasure to say anything to her, you will see what manner
      of grace and speech is hers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then said Bernage to her&mdash;&ldquo;Lady, your patience is as great as your
      torment. I hold you to be the most unhappy woman alive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With tears in her eyes, and with the humblest grace imaginable, the lady
      answered&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, I acknowledge my offence to have been so great that all the woes
      that the lord of this house (for I am not worthy to call him husband) may
      be pleased to lay upon me are nothing in comparison with the grief I feel
      at having offended him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, she began to weep bitterly. The gentleman took Bernage by the
      arm and led him away.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the following morning Bernage took his leave, in order to proceed on
      the mission that the King had given him. However, in bidding the gentleman
      farewell, he could not refrain from saying to him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, the love I bear you, and the honour and friendship that you have
      shown me in your house, constrain me to tell you that, having regard to
      the deep penitence of your unhappy wife, you should, in my opinion, take
      compassion upon her. You are, moreover, young and have no children, and it
      would be a great pity that so fair a lineage should come to an end, and
      that those who, perhaps, have no love for you, should become your heirs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman, who had resolved that he would never more speak to his
      wife, pondered a long time on the discourse held to him by the Lord de
      Bernage, and at last recognised that he had spoken truly, and promised him
      that, if his wife should continue in her present humility, he would at
      some time have pity upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly Bernage departed on his mission, and when he had returned to
      his master, the King, he told him the whole story, which the Prince, upon
      inquiry, found to be true. And as Bernage among other things had made
      mention of the lady&rsquo;s beauty, the King sent his painter, who was called
      John of Paris, (3) that he might make and bring him a living portrait of
      her, which, with her husband&rsquo;s consent, he did. And when she had long done
      penance, the gentleman, in his desire to have offspring, and in the pity
      that he felt for his wife who had submitted to this penance with so much
      humility, took her back again and afterwards had by her many handsome
      children. (4)

     3  John Perréal, called &ldquo;Jehan de Paris,&rdquo; was one of the
     most famous painters of the reigns of Charles VIII. and
     Louis XII. At the end of 1496 we find him resident at Lyons,
     and there enjoying considerable celebrity. From October 1498
     to November 1499 he figures in the roll of officers of the
     royal household, as valet of the wardrobe, with a salary of
     240 livres. In the royal stable accounts for 1508 he appears
     as receiving ten livres to defray the expense of keeping a
     horse during June and July that year. He is known to have
     painted the portrait and planned the obsequies of Philibert
     of Savoy in 1509; to have been sent to England in 1514 to
     paint a portrait of the Princess Mary, sister of Henry
     VIII., who married Louis XII.; and in 1515 to have had
     charge of all the decorative work connected with Louis
     XII.&lsquo;s obsequies. In his <i>Légende des Vénitiens</i> (1509) John
     Le Maire de Belges praises Perréal&rsquo;s skill both in landscape
     and portrait painting, and describes him as a most
     painstaking and hardworking artist. He had previously
     referred to him in his <i>Temple d&rsquo;Honneur et de Vertu</i> (1504)
     as being already at that period painter to the King. In the
     roll of the officers of Francis I.&lsquo;s household (1522)
     Perréal&rsquo;s name takes precedence of that of the better known
     Jehannet Clouet, but it does not appear in that of 1529,
     about which time he would appear to have died. Shortly
     before that date he had designed some curious initial
     letters for the famous Parisian printer and bookseller,
     Tory. The Claud Perréal, &ldquo;Lyonnese,&rdquo; whom Clement Marot
     commemorates in his 36th <i>Rondeau</i> would appear to have been
     a relative, possibly the son, of &ldquo;Jehan de Paris.&rdquo;&mdash;See Léon
     de La Borde&rsquo;s <i>Renaissance des Arts</i>, vol. i., Pericaud
     ainé&rsquo;s <i>Notice sur Jean de Paris</i>, Lyons, 1858, and more

     Paris, peintre et valet-de-chambre des rois Charles VIII.

     cruelty, in his <i>Vies des Dames Galantes</i>, Lalanne&rsquo;s
     edition, vol. ix. p. 38.&mdash;L.

      &ldquo;If, ladies, all those whom a like adventure has befallen, were to drink
      out of similar vessels, I greatly fear that many a gilt cup would be
      turned into a death&rsquo;s head. May God keep us from such a fortune, for if
      His goodness do not restrain us, there is none among us but might do even
      worse; but if we trust in Him He will protect those who confess that they
      are not able to protect themselves. Those who confide in their own
      strength are in great danger of being tempted so far as to be constrained
      to acknowledge their frailty. Many have stumbled through pride in this
      way, while those who were reputed less discreet have been saved with
      honour. The old proverb says truly, &lsquo;Whatsoever God keeps is well kept.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The punishment,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;was in my opinion a most reasonable

      &ldquo;I am not of your opinion,&rdquo; said Ennasuite. &ldquo;I would rather see the bones

      is no reparation possible.&rdquo;

    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not care what name men may give me,&rdquo; said Ennasuite, &ldquo;if only God

      should be willing to die.&rdquo;

      guilt had slain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Dagoucin,&rdquo; returned Simontault, &ldquo;have you still to learn that women
      know neither love nor even grief?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have still to learn it,&rdquo; said Dagoucin, &ldquo;for I have never made
      trial of their love, through fear of finding it less than I desired.&rdquo;
     </p>

      &ldquo;I am content,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;with the love that I feel within myself, and

      lurks even under the guise of a miracle, and for this reason I am minded

      <i>TALE XXXIII</i>.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>The hypocrisy of a priest who, under the cloak of sanctity,
     had got his sister with child, was discovered by the wisdom
     of the Count of Angoulême, by whose command they both were
     visited with punishment by law</i>. (1)
</pre>
    <p>
      Count Charles of Angoulême, father of King Francis, a pious Prince and one
      that feared God, happened to be at Coignac when he was told that in a
      village called Cherues, (2) not far away, there dwelt a maiden who lived a
      marvellously austere life, and who, for all that, was now great with
      child. She made no secret of the matter, but assured every one that she
      had never known a man and that she could not tell how such a fortune
      should have befallen her, unless indeed it were the work of the Holy
      Ghost. This explanation the people readily received, and knowing as they
      all did how virtuous she had been from her youth up, and how she had never
      given a single token of worldliness, they believed and deemed her a second
      Virgin Mary. She used to fast not only on the days commanded by the
      Church, but, from natural devotion, several times a week also; and she
      never stirred from the church whenever there was a service going on there.
      For these reasons she was held in such great repute among all the vulgar
      that every one came to see her as though she were a miracle, and those who
      succeeded in touching her dress deemed themselves fortunate indeed.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  This tale is historical, the incidents must have occurred
     between 1480 and 1490.&mdash;L.

     2  Cherves-de-Cognac, now a large village of nearly 3000
     inhabitants, within four miles of Cognac. The church, where
     some of the incidents recorded in the tale occurred, is
     still in existence. It dates from the eleventh and twelfth
     centuries, and is surmounted by three cupolas.&mdash;Eu.
</pre>
    <p>
      The priest of the parish was her brother; he was a man advanced in years
      and of very austere life, and was loved and reverenced by his
      parishioners, who held him for a holy man. He treated his sister with such
      harshness as to keep her shut up in a house, to the great discontent of
      all the people; and so greatly was the matter noised abroad that, as I
      have told you, the story reached the ear of the Count. He perceived that
      the people were being deceived, and, wishing to set them right, sent a
      Master of Requests and an Almoner, two very worthy men, to learn the
      truth. These repaired to the spot and inquired into the matter with all
      possible diligence, addressing themselves for information to the priest,
      who, being weary of the whole affair, begged them to be present at an
      examination which he hoped to hold on the morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early the next morning the said priest chanted mass, his sister, who was
      now far gone with child, being present on her knees; and when mass was
      over, the priest took the &ldquo;Corpus Domini,&rdquo; and in presence of the whole
      congregation said to his sister&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unhappy woman that you are, here is He who suffered death and agony for
      you, and in His presence I ask you whether, as you have ever affirmed to
      me, you are indeed a virgin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She boldly replied that she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is it possible that you can be with child and yet be still a virgin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can give no reason,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;except that the grace of the Holy
      Ghost has wrought within me according to His good pleasure; nevertheless,
      I cannot deny the grace that God has shown me in preserving me a virgin
      without ever a thought of marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Forthwith her brother said to her&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I offer you the precious Body of Jesus Christ, which you will take to
      your damnation if it be not as you say; and the gentlemen here present on
      behalf of my lord the Count shall be witnesses thereof.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The maiden, who was nearly thirty years of age, (3) then swore as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I take this Body of Our Lord, here present, to my damnation in the
      presence of you, gentlemen, and of you, my brother, if ever man has
      touched me any more than yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with these words she received the Body of Our Lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having witnessed this, the Master of Requests and the Almoner went away
      quite confounded, for they thought that no lie was possible with such an
      oath. And they reported the matter to the Count, and tried to persuade him
      even as they were themselves persuaded. But he was a man of wisdom, (4)
      and, after pondering a long time, bade them again repeat the terms of the
      oath. And after weighing them well, he said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has told you the truth and yet she has deceived you. She said that no
      man had ever touched her any more than her brother had done, and I feel
      sure that her brother has begotten this child and now seeks to hide his
      wickedness by a monstrous deception. We, however, who believe that Jesus
      Christ has come, can look for none other. Go, therefore, and put the
      priest in prison; I am sure that he will confess the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     3  In the MS. followed for this edition, as well as in
     Boaistuau&rsquo;s-version of the <i>Heptameron</i>, the age is given as
     &ldquo;thirteen.&rdquo; We borrow the word &ldquo;thirty&rdquo; from MS. 1518
     (Béthune).&mdash;L.

     4  Charles of Angoulême, father of King Francis and Queen
     Margaret, had received for the times a most excellent
     education, thanks to the solicitude of his father, Count
     John the Good, who further took upon himself to &ldquo;instruct
     him in morality, showing him by a good example how to live
     virtuously and honestly, and teaching him to pray God and
     obey His commandments.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Vie de très illustre et vertueux
     Prince Jean, Comte d&rsquo;Angoulême</i>, by Jean du Port, Angoulême,
     1589, p. 66. That Count Charles profited by this teaching is
     shown in the above tale.&mdash;ED.
</pre>
    <p>
      This was done according to his command, though not without serious
      remonstrances concerning the putting of this virtuous man to open shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albeit, as soon as the priest had been taken, he made confession of his
      wickedness, and told how he had counselled his sister to speak as she had
      done in order to conceal the life they had led together, not only because
      the excuse was one easy to be made, but also because such a false
      statement would enable them to continue living honoured by all. And when
      they set before him his great wickedness in taking the Body of Our Lord
      for her to swear upon, he made answer that he had not been so daring, but
      had used a wafer that was unconsecrated and unblessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Report was made of the matter to the Count of Angoulême, who commanded
      that the law should take its course. They waited until the sister had been
      delivered, and then, after she had been brought to bed of a fine male
      child, they burned brother and sister together. And all the people
      marvelled exceedingly at finding beneath the cloak of holiness so horrible
      a monster, and beneath a pious and praiseworthy life indulgence in so
      hateful a crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By this you see, ladies, how the faith of the good Count was not lessened
      by outward signs and miracles. He well knew that we have but one Saviour,
      who, when He said &lsquo;Consummatum est,&rsquo; (5) showed that no room was left for
      any successor to work our salvation.&rdquo;

      &ldquo;It was indeed,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;great daring and extreme hypocrisy to
      throw the cloak of Godliness and true Christianity over so enormous a
      sin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;that such as under pretext of a commission
      from the King do cruel and tyrannous deeds, receive a double punishment
      for having screened their own injustice behind the justice of the Crown.
      In the same way, we see that although hypocrites prosper for a time
      beneath the cloak of God and holiness, yet, when the Lord God lifts His
      cloak, they find themselves exposed and bare, and then their foul and
      abominable nakedness is deemed all the more hideous for having had so
      honourable a covering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing can be pleasanter,&rdquo; said Nomerfide, &ldquo;than to speak forth frankly
      the thoughts that are in the heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, for profit&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; (6) replied Longarine. &ldquo;I have no doubt that you
      give your opinion according to your temper.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     6  This sentence is rather obscure in the MSS., and we have
     adopted the reading suggested by M. Frank. M. Lacroix,
     however, was of opinion that the sentence should run, &ldquo;Yes,
     for mirth&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;&mdash;M.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you what it is,&rdquo; said Nomerfide. &ldquo;I find that fools, when
      they are not put to death, live longer than wise folk, and the only reason
      that I know for this, is that they do not conceal their passions. If they
      be angry, they strike; if they be merry, they laugh: whereas those that
      aim at wisdom conceal their imperfections with such exceeding care that
      they end by thoroughly corrupting their hearts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you are right,&rdquo; said Geburon, &ldquo;and that hypocrisy, whether
      towards God, man or Nature, is the cause of all our ills.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be a glorious thing,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;if our hearts were so
      filled with faith in Him, who is all virtue and all joy, that we could
      freely show them to every one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will come to pass,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;when all the flesh has left our
      bones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;the Spirit of God, which is stronger than Death, is
      able to mortify our hearts without changing or destroying the body.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; returned Saffredent, &ldquo;you speak of a gift of God that is not as
      yet common among mankind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is common,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;among those that have faith, but as this is
      a matter not to be understood by such as are fleshly minded, let us see to
      whom Simontault will give his vote.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will give it,&rdquo; said Simontault, &ldquo;to Nomerfide, for, since her heart is
      merry, her words cannot be sad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; said Nomerfide, &ldquo;since you desire to laugh, I will give you
      reason to do so. That you may learn how hurtful are ignorance and fear,
      and how the lack of comprehension is often the cause of much woe, I will
      tell you what happened to two Grey Friars, who, through failing to
      understand the words of a butcher, thought that they were about to die.&rdquo;

      <i>TALE XXXIV</i>.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>Two Grey Friars, while listening to secrets that did not
     concern them, misunderstood the language of a butcher and
     endangered their lives</i>. (1)
</pre>
    <p>
      Between Nyort and Fors there is a village called Grip, (2) which belongs
      to the Lord of Fors.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  This story is evidently founded upon fact; the incidents
     must have occurred prior to 1530.&mdash;L.

     2  Gript, a little village on the Courance, eight miles
     south of Niort (Deux-Sèvres), produces some of the best
     white wine in this part of France. Its church of St. Aubin
     stood partly in the diocese of Poitiers, partly in that of
     Saintes, the altar being in the former, and the door in the
     latter one. This is the only known instance of the kind in
     France. Fors, a few miles distant from Gript, was a fief
     which Catherine, daughter of Artus de Vivonne, brought in
     marriage to James Poussart, knight, who witnessed the Queen
     of Navarre&rsquo;s marriage contract, signing himself, &ldquo;Seigneur
     de Fors, Bailly du Berry.&rdquo; He is often mentioned in the
     Queen&rsquo;s letters.&mdash;See Génin&rsquo;s <i>Lettres de Marguerite, &amp;c</i>,
     pp. 243-244, 258-259, 332.&mdash;L. and M.
</pre>
    <p>
      It happened one day that two Grey Friars, on their way from Nyort, arrived
      very late at this place, Grip, and lodged in the house of a butcher. Now,
      as there was nothing between their host&rsquo;s room and their own but a badly
      joined partition of wood, they had a mind to listen to what the husband
      might say to his wife when he was in bed with her, and accordingly they
      set their ears close to the head of their host&rsquo;s bed. He, having no
      thought of his lodgers, spoke privately with his wife concerning their
      household, and said to her&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must rise betimes in the morning, sweetheart, and see after our Grey
      Friars. One of them is very fat, and must be killed; we will salt him
      forthwith and make a good profit off him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And although by &ldquo;Grey Friars&rdquo; he meant his pigs, the two poor brethren, on
      hearing this plot, felt sure that they themselves were spoken of, (3) and
      so waited with great fear and trembling for the dawn.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     3  The butcher doubtless called his pigs &ldquo;Grey Friars&rdquo; in
     allusion to the latter&rsquo;s gluttony and uncleanly habits. Pigs
     are even nowadays termed <i>moines</i> (monks) by the peasantry
     in some parts of France. Moreover, the French often render
     our expression &ldquo;fat as a pig&rdquo; by &ldquo;fat as a monk.&rdquo;&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      One of them was very fat and the other rather lean. The fat one wished to
      confess himself to his companion, saying that a butcher who had lost the
      love and fear of God would think no more of slaughtering him than if he
      were an ox or any other beast; and adding that as they were shut up in
      their room and could not leave it without passing through that of their
      host, they must needs look upon themselves as dead men, and commend their
      souls to God. But the younger Friar, who was not so overcome with fear as
      his comrade, made answer that, as the door was closed against them, they
      must e&rsquo;en try to get through the window, for, whatever befel them, they
      could meet with nothing worse than death; to which the fat Friar agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young one then opened the window, and, finding that it was not very
      high above the ground, leaped lightly down and fled as fast and as far as
      he could, without waiting for his companion. The latter attempted the same
      hazardous jump, but in place of leaping, fell so heavily by reason of his
      weight, that one of his legs was sorely hurt, and he could not rise from
      the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finding himself forsaken by his companion and being unable to follow him,
      he looked around him to see where he might hide, and could espy nothing
      save a pigsty, to which he dragged himself as well as he could. And as he
      opened the door to hide himself within, out rushed two huge pigs, whose
      place the unhappy Friar took, closing the little door upon himself, and
      hoping that, when he heard the sound of passers-by, he would be able to
      call out and obtain assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the morning was come, however, the butcher got ready his big
      knives, and bade his wife bear him company whilst he went to slaughter his
      fat pig. And when he reached the sty in which the Grey Friar lay
      concealed, he opened the little door and began to call at the top of his
      voice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come out, Master Grey Friar, come out! I intend to have some of your
      chitterlings to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The poor Friar, who was not able to stand upon his leg, crawled on
      all-fours out of the sty, crying for mercy as loud as he could. But if the
      hapless Friar was in great terror, the butcher and his wife were in no
      less; for they thought that St. Francis was wrathful with them for calling
      a beast a Grey Friar, and therefore threw themselves upon their knees
      asking pardon of St. Francis and his Order. Thus, the Friar was crying to
      the butcher for mercy on the one hand, and the butcher to the Friar on the
      other, in such sort that a quarter of an hour went by before they felt
      safe from each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perceiving at last that the butcher intended him no hurt, the good father
      told him the reason why he had hidden himself in the sty. Then was their
      fear turned to laughter, except, indeed, that the poor Friar&rsquo;s leg was too
      painful to suffer him to be merry. However, the butcher brought him into
      the house, where he caused the hurt to be carefully dressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      His comrade, who had deserted him in his need, ran all night long, and in
      the morning came to the house of the Lord of Fors, where he lodged a
      complaint against the butcher, whom he suspected of killing his companion,
      seeing that the latter had not followed him. The Lord of Fors forthwith
      sent to Grip to learn the truth, and this, when known, was by no means the
      cause of tears. And he failed not to tell the story to his mistress the
      Duchess of Angoulême, mother of King Francis, first of that name. (4)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     4  Many modern stories and anecdotes have been based on this
     amusing tale.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, ladies, how bad a thing it is to listen to secrets that do not
      concern us, and to misunderstand what other people say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I not know,&rdquo; said Simontault, &ldquo;that Nomer-fide would give us no cause
      to weep, but rather to laugh? And I think that we have all done so very
      heartily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How comes it,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;that we are more ready to be amused by a
      piece of folly than by something wisely done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;the folly is more agreeable to us, for it is more
      akin to our own nature, which of itself is never wise. And like is fond of
      like, the fool of folly, and the wise man of discretion. But I am sure,&rdquo;
       he continued, &ldquo;that no one, whether foolish or wise, could help laughing
      at this story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are some,&rdquo; said Geburon, &ldquo;whose hearts are so bestowed on the love
      of wisdom that, whatever they may hear, they cannot be made to laugh. They
      have a gladness of heart and a moderate content such as nought can move.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are they?&rdquo; asked Hircan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The philosophers of olden days,&rdquo; said Geburon. &ldquo;They were scarcely
      sensible of either sadness or joy, or at least they gave no token of
      either, so great a virtue did they deem the conquest of themselves and
      their passions. I too think, as they did, that it is well to subdue a
      wicked passion, but a victory over a natural passion, and one that tends
      to no evil, appears useless in my eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; added Geburon, &ldquo;the ancients held it for a great virtue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not maintained,&rdquo; said Saffredent, &ldquo;that they all were wise. They
      had more of the appearance of sense and virtue than of the reality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless, you will find that they rebuke everything bad,&rdquo; said
      Geburon. &ldquo;Diogenes himself, even, trod on the bed of Plato, who was too
      fond (5) of rare and precious things for his taste, and this in order to
      show that he despised Plato&rsquo;s vanity and greed, and would put them under
      foot. &lsquo;I trample with contempt,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;upon the pride of Plato.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you have not told all,&rdquo; said Saffredent, &ldquo;for Plato retorted that he
      did so from pride of another kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In truth,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;it is impossible to accomplish the conquest
      of ourselves without extraordinary pride. And this is the vice that we
      should fear most of all, for it springs from the death and destruction of
      all the virtues.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I not read to you this morning,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;that those who
      thought themselves wiser than other men, since by the sole light of reason
      they had come to recognise a God, creator of all things, were made more
      ignorant and irrational not only than other men, but than the very brutes,
      and this because they did not ascribe the glory to Him to whom it was due,
      but thought that they had gained the knowledge they possessed by their own
      endeavours? For having erred in their minds by ascribing to themselves
      that which pertains to God alone, they manifested their errors by disorder
      of body, forgetting and perverting their natural sex, as St. Paul to-day
      doth tell us in the Epistle that he wrote to the Romans.&rdquo; (6)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     5  The French word here is <i>curieux</i>, which in Margaret&rsquo;s
     time implied one fond of rare and precious things.&mdash;B. J

     6  <i>Romans</i> i. 26, 27.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is none among us,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;but will confess, on reading
      that Epistle, that outward sin is but the fruit of infelicity dwelling
      within, which, the more it is hidden by virtue and marvels, is the more
      difficult to pluck out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We men,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;are nearer to salvation than you are, for we do
      not conceal our fruits, and so the root is readily known; whereas you, who
      dare not display the fruit, and who do so many seemingly fair deeds, are
      hardly aware of the root of pride that is growing beneath so brave a
      surface.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I acknowledge,&rdquo; said Longarine, &ldquo;that if the Word of God does not show us
      by faith the leprosy of unbelief that lurks in the heart, yet God is very
      merciful to us when He allows us to fall into some visible wrongdoing
      whereby the hidden plague may be made manifest. Happy are they whom faith
      has so humbled that they have no need to test their sinful nature by
      outward acts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But just look where we are now,&rdquo; said Simontault. &ldquo;We started from a
      foolish tale, and we are now fallen into philosophy and theology. Let us
      leave these disputes to such as are more fitted for such speculation, and
      ask Nomerfide to whom she will give her vote.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I give it,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to Hircan, but I commend to him the honour of the
      ladies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could not have commended it in a better place,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;for the
      story that I have ready is just such a one as will please you. It will,
      nevertheless, teach you to acknowledge that the nature of men and women is
      of itself prone to vice if it be not preserved by Him to whom the honour
      of every victory is due. And to abate the pride that you display when a
      story is told to your honour, I will tell you one of a different kind that
      is strictly true.&rdquo;

      <i>TALE XXXV</i>.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>The affection of a lady of Pampeluna&mdash;who, thinking that
     there was no danger in spiritual love, had striven to
     insinuate herself into the good graces of a Grey Friar&mdash;was
     subdued by her husband&rsquo;s prudence in such wise that, without
     telling her that he knew aught of the matter, he brought her
     mortally to hate that which she had most dearly loved, and
     wholly to devote herself to him</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      In the town of Pampeluna there lived a lady who was accounted beautiful
      and virtuous, as well as the chastest and most pious in the land. She
      loved her husband, and was so obedient to him that he had entire trust in
      her. This lady was constantly present at Divine service and at sermons,
      and she used to persuade her husband and children to be hearers with her.
      She had reached the age of thirty years, at which women are wont to claim
      discretion rather than beauty, when on the first day of Lent she went to
      the church to receive the emblem of death. (1) Here she found that the
      sermon was beginning, the preacher being a Grey Friar, a man esteemed holy
      by all the people on account of his great austerity and goodness of life,
      which made him thin and pale, yet not to such a point as to prevent him
      from being one of the handsomest men imaginable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady listened piously to his sermon, her eyes being fixed on this
      reverend person, and her ears and mind ready to hearken to what he said.
      And so it happened that the sweetness of his words passed through the
      lady&rsquo;s ears even to her heart, while the comeliness and grace of his
      countenance passed through her eyes and so smote her soul that she was as
      one entranced. When the sermon was over, she looked carefully to see where
      the Friar would celebrate mass, (2) and there she presented herself to
      take the ashes from his hand. The latter was as fair and white as any
      lady&rsquo;s, and this pious lady paid more attention to it than to the ashes
      which it gave her.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  To receive the ashes on Ash Wednesday.&mdash;M.

     2  That is, in which of the chapels. A friar would not
     officiate at the high altar.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      Feeling persuaded that a spiritual love such as this, with any pleasure
      that she might derive from it, could not wound her conscience, she failed
      not to go and hear the sermon every day and to take her husband with her;
      and they both gave such great praise to the preacher, that they spoke of
      nought beside at table or elsewhere. At last this supposed spiritual fire
      became so carnal that the poor lady&rsquo;s heart in which it glowed began to
      consume her whole body; and just as she had been slow to feel the flame,
      so did she now swiftly kindle, and feel all the delights of passion,
      before she knew that she even was in love. Being thus surprised by her
      enemy, Love, she offered no further resistance to his commands. But the
      worst was that the physician who might have cured her ills was ignorant of
      her distemper; for which reason, banishing the dread she should have had
      of making known her foolishness to a man of wisdom, and her vice and
      wickedness to a man of virtue and honour, she proceeded to write to him of
      the love she bore him, doing this, to begin with, as modestly as she
      could. And she gave her letter to a little page, telling him what he had
      to do, and saying that he was to be careful above all things that her
      husband should not see him going to the monastery of the Grey Friars.
    </p>
    <p>
      The page, desiring to take the shortest way, passed through a street in
      which his master was sitting in a shop. Seeing him pass, the gentleman
      came out to observe whither he was going, and when the page perceived him,
      he was quite confused, and hid himself in a house. Noticing this, his
      master followed him, took him by the arm and asked him whither he was
      bound. Finding also that he had a terrified look and made but empty
      excuses, he threatened to beat him soundly if he did not confess the
      truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, sir,&rdquo; said the poor page, &ldquo;if I tell you, my lady will kill me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman, suspecting that his wife was making some bargain without
      his knowledge, promised the page that he should come by no hurt, and
      should be well rewarded, if he told the truth; whereas, if he lied, he
      should be thrown into prison for life. Thereupon the little page, eager to
      have the good and to avoid the evil, told him the whole story, and showed
      him the letter that his mistress had written to the preacher. At this her
      husband was the more astonished and grieved, as he had all his life long
      been persuaded of the faithfulness of his wife, in whom he had never
      discovered a fault.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, being a prudent man, he concealed his anger, and so that he
      might fully learn his wife&rsquo;s intention, he sent a reply as though from the
      preacher, thanking her for her goodwill, and declaring that his was as
      great towards her. The page, having sworn to his master that he would
      conduct the matter with discretion, (3) brought the counterfeit letter to
      his mistress, who was so greatly rejoiced by it that her husband could see
      that her countenance was changed; for, instead of growing lean from the
      fasts of Lent, she now appeared fairer and fresher than before they began.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     3  This is borrowed from MS. 1520. In our MS. the passage
     runs, &ldquo;The page having shown his master how to conduct this
     affair,&rdquo; &amp;c.&mdash;L.
</pre>
    <p>
      It was now mid-Lent, but no thought of the Passion or Holy Week prevented
      the lady from writing her frenzied fancies to the preacher according to
      her wont; and when he turned his eyes in her direction, or spoke of the
      love of God, she thought that all was done or said for love of her; and so
      far as her eyes could utter her thoughts, she did not spare them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The husband never failed to return her similar answers, but after Easter
      he wrote to her in the preacher&rsquo;s name, begging her to let him know how he
      could secretly see her. She, all impatient for the meeting, advised her
      husband to go and visit some estates of theirs in the country, and this he
      agreed to do, hiding himself, however, in the house of a friend. Then the
      lady failed not to write to the preacher that it was time he should come
      and see her, since her husband was in the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman, wishing thoroughly to try his wife&rsquo;s heart, then went to
      the preacher, and begged him for the love of God to lend him his robe. The
      preacher, who was a man of worth, replied that the rules of his Order
      forbade it, and that he would never lend his robe for a masquerade. (4)
      The gentleman assured him, however, that he would make no evil use of it,
      and that he wanted it for a matter necessary to his happiness and his
      salvation. Thereupon the Friar, who knew the other to be a worthy and
      pious man, lent it to him; and with this robe, which covered his face so
      that his eyes could not be seen, the gentleman put on a false beard and a
      false nose, each similar to the preacher&rsquo;s. He also made himself of the
      same height by means of cork. (5)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     4  This may be compared with the episode of Tappe-coue or
     Tickletoby in Pantagruel:&mdash;&ldquo;Villon, to dress an old clownish
     father grey-beard, who was to represent God the Father [at
     the performance of a mystery], begged of Friar Stephen
     Tickletoby, sacristan to the Franciscan Friars of the place,
     to lend him a cope and a stole. Tickletoby refused him,
     alleging that by their provincial statutes it was rigorously
     forbidden to give or lend anything to players. Villon
     replied that the statute reached no further than farces,
     drolls, antics, loose and dissolute games.... Tickletoby,
     however, peremptorily bid him provide himself elsewhere, if
     he would, and not to hope for anything out of his monastical
     wardrobe.... Villon gave an account of this to the players
     as of a most abominable action; adding that God would
     shortly revenge himself and make an example of Tickletoby.&rdquo;&mdash;
     Urquhart&rsquo;s <i>Works of Rabelais, Pantagruel</i>, (Book IV.
     xiii.)&mdash;M.

     5  In Boaistuau&rsquo;s edition the sentence runs, &ldquo;and by putting
     some cork in his shoes made himself of the same height as
     the preacher.&rdquo;&mdash;L.
</pre>
    <p>
      Thus garmented, he repaired in the evening to his wife&rsquo;s apartment, where
      she was very piously awaiting him. The poor fool did not tarry for him to
      come to her, but ran to embrace him like a woman bereft of reason. Keeping
      his face bent down lest he should be recognised, he then began making the
      sign of the cross, and pretended to flee from her, saying the while
      nothing but&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Temptation! temptation!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, father,&rdquo; said the lady, &ldquo;you are indeed right, for there is no
      stronger temptation than that which proceeds from love. But for this you
      have promised me a remedy; and I pray you, now that we have time and
      opportunity, to take pity upon me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, she strove to embrace him, but he ran all round the room,
      making great signs of the cross, and still crying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Temptation! temptation!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      However, when he found that she was urging him too closely, he took a big
      stick that he had beneath his cloak and beat her so sorely as to end her
      temptation, and that without being recognised by her. Then he immediately
      went and returned the robe to the preacher, assuring him that it had
      brought him good fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morrow, pretending to come from a distance, he returned home and
      found his wife in bed, when, as though he knew nothing of her sickness, he
      asked her the cause of it; and she replied that it was a catarrh, and that
      she could move neither hand nor foot. The husband, who was much inclined
      to laugh, made as though he were greatly grieved, and as if to cheer her
      told her that he had bidden the saintly preacher to supper that evening.
      But she quickly replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God forbid, sweetheart, that you should ever invite such folk. They bring
      misfortune into every house they visit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, sweet,&rdquo; said the husband, &ldquo;how is this? You have always greatly
      praised this man, and for my own part I believe that if there be a holy
      man on earth, it is he.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are good in church and when preaching,&rdquo; answered the lady, &ldquo;but in
      our houses they are very antichrists. I pray you, sweet, let me not see
      him, for with my present sickness it would be enough to kill me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since you do not wish to see him,&rdquo; returned the husband, &ldquo;you shall not
      do so, but I must have him here to supper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do what you will,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;but let me not see him, for I hate such
      folk as I do the devil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After giving supper to the good father, the husband said to him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, I believe you to be so beloved of God, that He will refuse you no
      request. I therefore entreat you to take pity on my poor wife, who for a
      week past has been possessed by the evil spirit in such a way, that she
      tries to bite and scratch every one. She cares for neither cross nor holy
      water, but I verily believe that if you will lay your hand upon her the
      devil will come forth, and I therefore earnestly entreat you to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My son,&rdquo; said the good father, &ldquo;all things are possible to a believer. Do
      you, then, firmly believe that God in His goodness never refuses those
      that in faith seek grace from Him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do, father,&rdquo; said the gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be also assured, my son,&rdquo; said the friar, &ldquo;that He can do what He will,
      and that He is even as powerful as He is good. Let us go, then, strong in
      faith to withstand this roaring lion, and to pluck from him his prey, whom
      God has purchased by the blood of Jesus Christ, His Son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, the gentleman led this worthy man to where his wife lay on a
      little bed. She, thinking that it was the Friar who had beaten her, was
      much astonished to see him there and exceedingly wrathful; however, her
      husband being present, she cast down her eyes, and remained dumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As long as I am with her,&rdquo; said the husband to the holy man, &ldquo;the devil
      scarcely torments her. But sprinkle some holy water upon her as soon as I
      am gone, and you will soon see how the evil spirit does his work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The husband left them alone together, and waited at the door to see how
      they would behave. When the lady saw no one with her but the good father,
      she began to cry out like a woman bereft of reason, calling him rascal,
      villain, murderer, betrayer. At this, the good father, thinking that she
      was surely possessed by an evil spirit, tried to put his hands upon her
      head, in order to utter his prayers upon it; but she scratched and bit him
      in such a fashion, that he was obliged to speak at a greater distance,
      whence, throwing a great deal of holy water upon her, he pronounced many
      excellent prayers.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the husband saw that the Friar had done his duty, he came into the
      room and thanked him for his trouble. At his entrance his wife ceased her
      cursings and revilings, and meekly kissed the cross in the fear she had of
      him. But the holy man, having seen her in so great a frenzy, firmly
      believed that Our Lord had cast out the devil in answer to his prayer, and
      he went away, praising God for this wonderful miracle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The husband, seeing that his wife was well punished for her foolish fancy,
      did not tell her of what he had done. He was content to have subdued her
      affection by his own prudence, and to have so dealt with her that she now
      hated mortally what she had formerly loved, and, loathing her folly,
      devoted herself to her husband and household more completely than she had
      ever done before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In this story, ladies, you see the good sense of a husband and the
      frailty of a woman of repute. I think that if you look carefully into this
      mirror you will no longer trust to your own strength, but will learn to
      have recourse to Him who holds your honour in His hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am well pleased,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;to find you become a preacher to
      the ladies, and I should be even more so if you would make these fine
      sermons to all those with whom you speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whenever you are willing to listen to me,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;I promise you
      that I will say as much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In other words,&rdquo; said Simontault, &ldquo;when you are not present, he will
      speak in a different fashion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will do as he pleases,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;but for my content I wish to
      believe that he always speaks in this way. At all events, the example he
      has brought forward will be profitable to those who believe that spiritual
      love is not dangerous. In my opinion it is more so than any other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;it seems to me that to love a worthy, virtuous and
      God-fearing man is in nowise a matter for scorn, and that one cannot but
      be the better for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;I pray you believe that no one can be more
      simple or more easily deceived than a woman who has never loved. For in
      itself love is a passion that seizes upon the heart before one is aware of
      it, and so pleasing a passion is it that, if it can make use of virtue as
      a cloak, it will scarcely be recognised before some mischief has come of
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What mischief,&rdquo; asked Oisille, &ldquo;can come of loving a worthy man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;there are a good many men that are esteemed
      worthy, but to be worthy in respect of the ladies, and to be careful for
      their honour and conscience&mdash;not one such man as that could, I think,
      be found in these days. Those who think otherwise, and put their trust in
      men, find at last that they have been deceived, and, having begun such
      intimacy with obedience to God, will often end it with obedience to the
      devil. I have known many who, under pretext of speaking about God, began
      an intimacy from which they could not withdraw when at last they wished to
      do so, being held in subjection by this semblance of virtue. A vicious
      love perishes of its own nature, and cannot continue in a good heart, but
      virtuous love has bonds of silk so fine that one is caught in them before
      they are seen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;According to you,&rdquo; said Ennasuite, &ldquo;no woman should ever love a man; but
      your law is too harsh a one to last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;but none the less must I desire that
      every one were as content with her own husband as I am with mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ennasuite, who felt that these words touched her, changed colour and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to believe every one the same at heart as yourself, unless,
      indeed, you think yourself more perfect than all others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;to avoid dispute, let us see to whom Hircan will
      give his vote.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I give it,&rdquo; Hircan replied, &ldquo;to Ennasuite, in order to make amends to her
      for what my wife has said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, since it is my turn,&rdquo; said Ennasuite, &ldquo;I will spare neither man nor
      woman, that all may fare alike. I see right well that you are unable to
      subdue your hearts to acknowledge the virtue and goodness of men, for
      which reason I am obliged to resume the discourse with a story like to the
      last.&rdquo;

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>By means of a salad a President of Grenoble avenged himself
     upon one of his clerks with whom his wife was smitten, and
     so saved the honour of his house</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      In the town of Grenoble there dwelt a President whose name I shall not
      mention, but he was not a Frenchman. (1) He had a very beautiful wife, and
      they lived in great tranquillity together.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  The personage referred to is Jeffroy Charles or Carles,
     Chief President of the Parliament of Grenoble, and President
     of the Senate of Turin; his wife&rsquo;s name was Margaret du
     Mottet; she came of a very old family of Embrun. Some
     interesting particulars concerning President Charles,
     supplied by that erudite scholar M. Jules Roman, will be
     found in the Appendix to the present volume (A).&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      This lady, finding that her husband was now old, fell in love with a young
      clerk, called Nicholas. When the President went to the court in the
      morning, Nicholas used to enter his room and take his place. This was
      observed by a servant of the President&rsquo;s who had served his master well
      for thirty years, and in his faithfulness he could not refrain from
      speaking to him of the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The President, being a prudent man, would not lightly believe the story,
      but said that the servant wished to create contention between himself and
      his wife. If the matter, said he, were really as the servant declared, he
      could easily prove it to him, and if proof were not given he would believe
      that it was a lie contrived in order to destroy the love existing between
      himself and his wife. The servant promised that he would show him the
      truth of what he had said, and one morning, as soon as the President was
      gone to the court and Nicholas had entered the room, he sent one of his
      fellow-servants to tell his master to come, while he himself remained
      watching at the door lest Nicholas should come out.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the President saw the sign that was made to him by one of his
      servants, he pretended to be ill, left the court and hastened home. Here
      he found his old servant at the door, and was assured by him that Nicholas
      was inside and had only just gone in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not stir from this door,&rdquo; said his lord to him, &ldquo;for, as you are
      aware, there is no other means of going into or out of the room, except
      indeed by way of a little closet of which I myself alone carry the key.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The President entered the room and found his wife and Nicholas in bed
      together. The clerk, clad in nothing but his shirt, threw himself at his
      feet to entreat forgiveness, while his wife began to weep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then said the President&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Though you have done a deed the enormity of which you may yourself judge,
      I am yet unwilling that my house should be dishonoured on your account,
      and the daughters I have had by you made to suffer. Wherefore,&rdquo; he
      continued, &ldquo;cease to weep, I command you, and hearken to what I am going
      to do; and do you, Nicholas, hide yourself in my closet and make not a
      single sound.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When this was done, he opened the door, and calling his old servant, said
      to him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you not assure me that you would show me Nicholas in company with my
      wife? Trusting in your word, I came hither in danger of killing my poor
      wife, and I have found nothing of what you told me. I have searched the
      whole room, as I will show you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he caused his servant to look under the beds and in every
      quarter. The servant, finding nothing, was greatly astonished, and said to
      his master&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil must have made away with him, for I saw him go in, and he did
      not come out through the door. But I can see that he is not here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then said his master to him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a wicked servant to try to create contention in this way between
      my wife and me. I dismiss you, and will pay you what I owe you for your
      services to me, and more besides; but be speedily gone, and take care that
      you are not in the town twenty-four hours from now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The President paid him for five or six years in advance, and, knowing him
      to be a faithful servant, resolved to reward him still further.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the servant was gone weeping away, the President made Nicholas come
      forth from the closet, and after telling them both what he thought of
      their wickedness, he commanded them to give no hint of the matter to
      anyone. He also charged his wife to dress more bravely than was her wont,
      and to attend all assemblies, dances and feasts; and he told Nicholas to
      make more merry than before, but, as soon as he whispered to him,
      &ldquo;Begone,&rdquo; to see that he was out of the town before three hours were over.
      Having arranged matters in this way, he returned to the court, none being
      any the wiser. And for a fortnight, contrary to his wont, he entertained
      his friends and neighbours, and after the banquet had the tabourers, so
      that the ladies might dance.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, seeing that his wife was not dancing, he commanded Nicholas to
      lead her out. The clerk, thinking that the past had been forgotten, did so
      gladly, but when the dance was over, the President, under pretence of
      charging him with some household matter, whispered to him, &ldquo;Begone, and
      come back no more.&rdquo; And albeit Nicholas was grieved to leave his mistress,
      yet was he no less glad that his life was spared.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the President had convinced all his kinsfolk and friends and the
      whole countryside of the deep love that he bore his wife, he went into his
      garden one fine day in the month of May to gather a salad, of such herbs
      that his wife did not live for twenty-four hours after eating of them;
      whereupon he made such a great show of mourning that none could have
      suspected him of causing her death; and in this way he avenged himself
      upon his enemy, and saved the honour of his house. (2)

     2  Whilst admitting the historical basis of this story, M.
     Le Roux de Lincy conceives it to be the same as No. xlvii.
     of the <i>Cent Nouvelles Nouvelles</i>, printed half-a-century
     before the <i>Heptameron</i> was written. Beyond the
     circumstance, however, that in both cases a judge is shown
     privily avenging himself on his wife for her infidelity,
     there is no resemblance between the two tales. There is good
     reason for believing that Queen Margaret&rsquo;s narrative is
     based on absolute fact, and not on the story in the <i>Cent
     Nouvelles</i>. Both tales have often been imitated. See for
     instance Bonaventure Despéricr&rsquo;s <i>Contes, Nouvelles, et
     joyeux Devis</i> (tale xcii., or, in some editions, xc. ); <i>Les
     Heures de Récréation de Louis Guicciardini</i>, p. 28; G.
     Giraldi Cinthio&rsquo;s <i>Hecatommithi, overro cento Novelle, &amp;c</i>.
     (dec. iii. nov. vi. ); Malespini&rsquo;s <i>Ducento Novelle </i>(part
     ii. nov. xvi.); Verboquet&rsquo;s <i>Les Délices, &amp;c</i>, 1623, p. 23;
     and Shirley&rsquo;s <i>Love&rsquo;s Cruelly</i>. These tales also inspired
     some of the Spanish dramatists, notably Calderon.&mdash;Ed. and

      &ldquo;I do not mean by this, ladies, to praise the President&rsquo;s conscience, but
      rather to bring out the frailty of a woman and the great patience and
      prudence of a man. And I beg you, ladies, be not angered by the truth,
      which sometimes speaks as loudly against ourselves as against the men; for
      vice and virtue are common alike to men and women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If all those,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;who have fallen in love with their
      servants were obliged to eat salads of that kind, I know some who would be
      less fond of their gardens than they are at present, and who would pluck
      up the herbs to get rid of such as restore the honour of a family by
      compassing the death of a wanton mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hircan, who guessed why she had said this, angrily replied&mdash;&ldquo;A
      virtuous woman should never judge another guilty of what she would not do
      herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Knowledge is not judgment nor yet foolishness,&rdquo; returned Parlamente.
      &ldquo;However, this poor woman paid the penalty that many others have deserved,
      and I think that the President, when desirous of vengeance, comported
      himself with wondrous prudence and wisdom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And with great malevolence, also,&rdquo; said Longarine. &ldquo;&lsquo;Twas a slow and
      cruel vengeance, and showed he had neither God nor conscience before his
      eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what would you have had him do,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;to revenge himself
      for the greatest wrong that a woman can deal to a man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would have had him kill her in his wrath,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;The doctors
      say that since the first impulses of passion are not under a man&rsquo;s
      control, such a sin may be forgiven; so it might have obtained pardon.&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Geburon, &ldquo;but his daughters and descendants would have always
      borne the stain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He ought not to have killed her at all,&rdquo; said Longarine, &ldquo;for, when his
      wrath was past, she might have lived with him in virtue, and nothing would
      ever have been said about the matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think,&rdquo; said Saffredent, &ldquo;that he was appeased merely because he
      concealed his anger? For my part, I believe that he was as wrathful on the
      last day, when he made his salad, as he had been on the first, for there
      are persons whose first impulses have no rest until their passion has
      worked its will. I am well pleased you say that the theologians deem such
      sins easy to be pardoned, for I am of their opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is well to look to one&rsquo;s words,&rdquo; said Longarine, &ldquo;in presence of
      persons so dangerous as you. What I said is to be understood of passion
      when it is so strong that it suddenly seizes upon all the senses, and
      reason can find no place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is so,&rdquo; said Saffredent, &ldquo;that I understood your words, and I thence
      conclude that, whatever a man may do, he can commit only venial sin if he
      be deeply in love. I am sure that, if Love hold him fast bound, Reason can
      never gain a hearing, whether from his heart or from his understanding.
      And if the truth be told, there is not one among us but has had knowledge
      of such passion; and not merely do I think that sin so committed is
      readily pardoned, but I even believe that God is not angered by it, seeing
      that such love is a ladder whereby we may climb to the perfect love of
      Himself. And none can attain to this save by the ladder of earthly love,
      (3) for, as St. John says, &lsquo;He that loveth not his brother whom he hath
      seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?&rsquo;&rdquo; (4)

      &ldquo;There is not a passage in Scripture,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;too good for you to
      turn to your own purposes. But beware of doing like the spider, which
      transforms sound meat into poison. Be advised that it is a perilous matter
      to quote Scripture out of place and without cause.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you call speaking the truth out of place and without cause?&rdquo; said
      Saffredent. &ldquo;You hold, then, that when, in speaking to you unbelieving
      women, we call God to our assistance, we take His name in vain; but if
      there be any sin in this, you alone must bear the blame, for it is your
      unbelief that compels us to seek out all the oaths that we can think of.
      And in spite of it all, we cannot kindle the flame of charity in your icy
      hearts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Longarine, &ldquo;proves that you all speak falsely. If truth were
      in your words, it is strong enough to make you be believed. Yet there is
      danger lest the daughters of Eve should hearken too readily to the
      serpent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see clearly,&rdquo; said Saffredent, &ldquo;that women are not to be conquered by
      men. So I shall be silent, and see to whom Ennasuite will give her vote.&rdquo;

      &ldquo;I give it,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to Dagoucin, for I think he would not willingly

    <p>
      &ldquo;Would to God,&rdquo; said Dagoucin, &ldquo;that they were as well disposed towards me
      as I am towards them. To show you that I have striven to honour the
      virtuous among them by recalling their good deeds, I will now tell you the
      story of such a one. I will not deny, ladies, that the patience of the
      gentleman at Pampeluna, and of the President at Grenoble was great, but
      then it was equalled in magnitude by their vengeance. Moreover, when we
      seek to praise a virtuous man, we ought not so to exalt a single virtue as
      to make of it a cloak for the concealment of grievous vice; for none are
      praiseworthy save such as do virtuous things from the love of virtue
      alone, and this I hope to prove by telling you of the patient virtue of a
      lady whose goodness had no other object save the honour of God and the
      salvation of her husband.&rdquo;

      <i>TALE XXXVII</i>.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>The Lady of Loué so influenced her husband by her great
     patience and longsuffering, that she drew him from his evil
     ways, and they lived afterwards in greater love than
     before</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      There was a lady of the house of Loué (1) who was so prudent and virtuous,
      that she was loved and esteemed by all her neighbours. Her husband trusted
      her, as well he might, with all his affairs, and she managed them with
      such wisdom that his house came, by her means, to be one of the wealthiest
      and best appointed in either the land of Anjou or Touraine.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  Loué is in Anjou, in the department of the Sarthe, being
     the chief locality of a canton of the arrondissement of Le
     Mans. The Lady of Loué referred to may be either Philippa de
     Beaumont-Bressuire, wife of Peter de Laval, knight, Lord of
     Loué, Benars, &amp;c.; or her daughter-in-law, Frances de
     Maillé, who in or about 1500 espoused Giles de Laval, Lord
     of Loué. Philippa is known to have died in 1525, after
     bearing her husband five children. She had been wedded fifty
     years. However, the subject of this story is the same as
     that of the Lady of Langallier, or Languillier (also in
     Anjou), which will be found in chapter xvii. of <i>Le Livre du
     Chevalier de la Tour-Landry</i>, an English translation of
     which, made in the reign of Henry VI., was edited in 1868 by
     Mr. Thomas Wright for the Early English Text Society.&mdash;See
     also Le Roux de Lincy&rsquo;s <i>Femmes célèbres de l&rsquo;ancienne
     France,</i> vol i. p. 356. Particulars concerning the Laval-
     Loué family will be found in Duchesne&rsquo;s Histoire de la
     Maison de Montmorency.&mdash;L. and M.
</pre>
    <p>
      In this fashion she lived a great while with her husband, to whom she bore
      several handsome children; but then, as happiness is always followed by
      its opposite, hers began to be lessened. Her husband, finding virtuous
      ease to be unendurable, laid it aside to seek for toil, and made it his
      wont to rise from beside his wife as soon as she was asleep, and not to
      return until it was nearly morning. The lady of Loué took this conduct
      ill, and falling into a deep unrest, of which she was fain to give no
      sign, neglected her household matters, her person and her family, like one
      that deemed herself to have lost the fruit of her toils, to wit, her
      husband&rsquo;s exceeding love, for the preserving of which there was no pain
      that she would not willingly have endured. But having lost it, as she
      could see, she became careless of everything else in the house, and the
      lack of her care soon brought mischief to pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband, on the one part, spent with much extravagance, while, on the
      other, she had ceased to control the management, so that ere long affairs
      fell into such great disorder, that the timber began to be felled, and the
      lands to be mortgaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of her kinsfolk that had knowledge of her distemper, rebuked her for
      her error, saying that if love for her husband did not lead her to care
      for the advantage of his house, she should at least have regard to her
      poor children. Hereat her pity for them caused her to recover herself, and
      she tried all means to win back her husband&rsquo;s love.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this wise she kept good watch one night, and, when he rose from beside
      her, she also rose in her nightgown, let make her bed, and said her
      prayers until her husband returned. And when he came in, she went to him
      and kissed him, and brought him a basin full of water that he might wash
      his hands. He was surprised at this unwonted behaviour, and told her that
      there was no need for her to rise, since he was only coming from the
      latrines; whereat she replied that, although it was no great matter, it
      was nevertheless a seemly thing to wash one&rsquo;s hands on coming from so
      dirty and foul a place, intending by these words to make him perceive and
      abhor the wickedness of his life. But for all that he did not mend his
      ways, and for a full year the lady continued to act in this way to no
      purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, seeing that this behaviour served her naught, one day, while
      she was waiting for her husband, who tarried longer than ordinary, she had
      a mind to go in search of him, and, passing from room to room, found him
      at last in a closet at the back of the house, lying asleep by the side of
      the ugliest, vilest, and filthiest serving-woman they had.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon, thinking she would teach him to leave so excellent a wife for
      so filthy and vile a woman, she took some straw and set it on fire in the
      middle of the room; but on seeing that it would as soon kill her husband
      as awaken him, she plucked him by the arm, crying out&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fire! fire!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If the husband was ashamed and sorry at being found by so virtuous a wife
      in company with such a slut, he certainly had good reason for it. Then
      said his wife to him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a year, sir, have I tried by gentle and patient means to draw you
      from this wickedness, and to show you that whilst washing the outside you
      should also cleanse that which is within. Finding that all I could do was
      of no avail, I have sought assistance from that clement which brings all
      things to an end, and I promise you, sir, that, if this do not mend you, I
      know not whether I shall a second time be able to deliver you from the
      danger as I have now done. I pray you remember that the deepest despair is
      that caused by love, and that if I had not had the fear of God before my
      eyes I could not have endured so much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The husband, glad to get off so easily, promised that he would never again
      cause her any pain on his account. This the lady was very willing to
      believe, and with her husband&rsquo;s consent turned away the servant who had so
      offended her. And from that time forth they lived most lovingly together,
      so that even the errors of the past, by the good that had resulted from
      them, served but to increase their happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Should God give you such husbands, ladies, I pray you despair not until
      you have fully tried all means to win them back. There are twenty-four
      hours in the day in which a man may change his mind, and a wife who has
      gained her husband over by patience and longsuffering should deem herself
      more fortunate than if fate and her kinsfolk had given her one more
      perfect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is an example,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;that all married women ought to
      follow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Follow it who will,&rdquo; said Parlamente; &ldquo;for my own part, I should find it
      impossible to be patient so long. Although in every condition patience is
      a seemly virtue, yet I think that in wedded life it finally produces
      ill-will. For, when suffering is caused you by your partner, you are
      compelled to keep yourself as much apart from him as possible; and from
      such estrangement there springs up contempt for the faithless one; and
      this contempt gradually lessens love, for a thing is loved in proportion
      as it is esteemed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there is a danger,&rdquo; said Ennasuite, &ldquo;that the impatient wife may meet
      with a passionate husband who, instead of patience, will bring her pain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what more,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;could a husband do than was done by the
      husband in the story?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What more?&rdquo; said Ennasuite. &ldquo;Why, beat his wife soundly, and make her lie
      in the smaller bed, and his sweetheart in the larger.&rdquo; (2)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     2  At this period, and for some time afterwards, there were
     usually two beds in the master&rsquo;s room, a large one for
     himself and his wife, and a small one in which slept a
     trusty servant, male or female. These little beds are shown
     in some of the designs engraved by Abraham Bosse in the
     seventeenth century.&mdash;L.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my belief,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;that a true woman would be less
      grieved by being beaten in anger than by being contemned for one of less
      worth than herself. After enduring the severance of love, nothing that her
      husband could do would be able to cause her any further pain. And in this
      wise the story says that the trouble she took to regain him was for the
      sake of her children&mdash;which I can well believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you think that it showed great patience on her part,&rdquo; said
      Nomerfide, &ldquo;to kindle a fire beneath the bed on which her husband was
      sleeping.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Longarine; &ldquo;for when she saw the smoke she waked him, and
      herein, perhaps, was she most to blame; for the ashes of such a husband as
      hers would to my thinking have been good for the making of lye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are cruel, Longarine,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;but those are not the terms on
      which you lived with your own husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Longarine, &ldquo;for, God be thanked, he never gave me cause. I have
      reason to regret him all my life long, not to complain of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if he had behaved in such a manner towards you,&rdquo; said Nomerfide,
      &ldquo;what would you have done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I loved him so dearly,&rdquo; said Longarine, &ldquo;that I believe I should have
      killed him, and myself as well. To die after taking such a vengeance would
      have been sweeter to me than to live faithfully with the faithless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far as I can see,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;you do not love your husbands except
      for your own sakes. If they are what you want them to be, you are very
      fond of them; but if they fall into the slightest error towards you, they
      lose on a Saturday the toil of an entire week. Thus you are minded to
      rule, and I for my part will consent to it provided, however, that all
      other husbands agree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is reasonable,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;that man should rule us as our head,
      but not that he should forsake us or treat us ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God has provided so wisely,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;both for man and for woman,
      that I hold marriage, if it be not abused, to be the goodliest and
      securest condition imaginable, and I am sure that, whatever they may seem
      to do, all here present think the same. And if the man claims to be wiser
      than the woman, he will be the more severely blamed should the fault come
      from him. But enough of such talk. Let us now see to whom Dagoucin will
      give his vote.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I give it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to Longarine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do me a great pleasure,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;for I have read a story that
      is worthy to follow yours. Since we are set upon praising the virtuous
      patience of ladies, I will show you one more worthy of praise than she of
      whom we have just been speaking. And she is the more deserving of esteem
      in that she was a city dame, and therefore one of those whose breeding is
      less virtuous than that of others.&rdquo;

     1  It is probable that the incidents related in this tale
     occurred between 1460 and 1470. They will be found recorded
     in the <i>Ménagier de Paris</i>. (See Baron Pichon&rsquo;s edition,
     1847, vol. i. p. 237). A similar narrative figures in some
     editions of Morlini&rsquo;s tales, notably the <i>Novello, Fabello,
     et Comedies, Neapoli</i>, 1520. We further find it in
     Gueudeville&rsquo;s translation of Erasmus&rsquo;s Colloquies (<i>Dialogue
     sur le mariage, collogues, &amp;c., Leyden</i>, 1720, vol. i. p.
     87), and Mr. Walter Keily has pointed out (the <i>Heptameron</i>,
     Bohn, 1864) that William Warner worked the same incidents
     into his poem <i>Albion&rsquo;s England</i>, his stanzas being
     reproduced in Percy&rsquo;s <i>Reliques</i> under the title of <i>The
     Patient Countess</i>.&mdash;L. and Ed.

      In the city of Tours there dwelt a chaste and comely townswoman, who, by
      reason of her virtues, was not only loved but feared also and respected by
      her husband. Nevertheless, with all the fickleness of men who grow weary
      of ever eating good bread, he fell in love with a farm tenant (2) of his
      own, and would oft-time leave Tours to visit the farm, where he always
      remained two or three days; and when he came back to Tours he was always
      in so sorry a plight that his wife had much ado to cure him, yet, as soon
      as he was whole again, he never failed to return to the place where
      pleasure caused him to forget all his ills.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     2  The French word here is <i>métayère</i>. The <i>métayer</i> (fem.
     métayère) was a farm tenant under the general control of his
     landlord, who supplied him with seed and took to himself a
     considerable portion of the produce. The system was done
     away with at the Revolution, but was revived here and there
     under the Restoration, when some of the nobles came to
     &ldquo;their own&rdquo; again, and there may even nowadays be a few
     instances of the kind.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      When his wife, who was anxious above all things for his life and health,
      found him constantly return home in so evil a plight, she went to the farm
      and found there the young woman whom her husband loved. Then, without
      anger but with graceful courage, she told her that she knew her husband
      often went to see her, but that she was ill-pleased to find him always
      return home exhausted in consequence of her sorry treatment of him. The
      poor woman, influenced as much by respect for her mistress as by regard
      for the truth, was not able to deny the fact, and craved forgiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady asked to see the room and bed in which her husband was wont to
      sleep, and found it so cold and dirty and ill-appointed that she was moved
      to pity. Forthwith she sent for a good bed furnished with sheets, blankets
      and counterpane such as her husband loved; she caused the room to be made
      clean and neat and hung with tapestries; provided suitable ware for his
      meat and drink, a pipe of good wine, sweetmeats and confections, and
      begged the woman to send him back no more in so miserable a state.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not long before the husband again went, as was his wont, to see his
      tenant, and he was greatly amazed to find his poor lodging in such
      excellent order. And still more was he surprised when the woman gave him
      to drink in a silver cup; and he asked her whence all these good things
      had come. The poor woman told him, weeping, that they were from his wife,
      who had taken such great pity on his sorry treatment that she had
      furnished the house in this way, and had charged her to be careful of his
      health.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the gentleman saw the exceeding generosity of his wife in returning
      so much good for all the evil turns that he had done her, he looked upon
      his own wrongdoing as no less great than her kindness; and, after giving
      some money to his tenant, he begged her to live in future as an honest
      woman. Then he went back to his wife, acknowledged his wrongdoing, and
      told her that, but for her great gentleness and generosity, he could never
      have forsaken the life that he had been leading. And thenceforward,
      forgetting the past, they lived in all peacefulness together.

      &ldquo;You may be sure, ladies, that there are but few husbands whom a wife&rsquo;s
      love and patience cannot win at last, unless they be harder even than
      stone, which weak and yielding water will in time make hollow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That woman,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;had neither heart, gall nor liver.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you have had her do?&rdquo; said Longarine. &ldquo;She practised what God
      commands, and returned good for evil.&rdquo; (3)

      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;she must have been in love with some Grey Friar,
      who had laid upon her the penance of having her husband well treated in
      the country, so that, meantime, she might be free to entertain herself
      well in the town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Therein,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;you clearly show the wickedness of your own
      heart, judging ill of a good deed. I rather believe her to have been so
      subdued by the love of God that she cared for naught save the salvation of
      her husband&rsquo;s soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; said Simontault, &ldquo;that he had more reason to return to
      his wife when he was so cold at the farm than afterwards when he was
      treated so well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From what I can see,&rdquo; said Saffredent, &ldquo;you are not of the same opinion
      as the rich man of Paris who, when he lay with his wife, could not put off
      his gear without being chilled, but who never felt the worse when he went
      without cap or shoes, in the depth of winter, to see his servant-maid in
      the cellar. Yet his wife was very beautiful and the maid very ugly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you not heard,&rdquo; said Geburon, &ldquo;that God always aids lunatics, lovers
      and sots? Perhaps he was all three in one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you thence conclude,&rdquo; said Pariamente, &ldquo;that God recks not of the
      wise, the chaste and the temperate? Help is not needed by those who can
      help themselves. He who said that He had come for the sick and not for the
      whole, (4) came by the law of His mercy to succour our infirmities,
      thereby annulling the decrees of His rigorous justice; and he that deems
      himself wise is a fool in the sight of God. But, to end the sermon, to
      whom will Longarine give her vote?&rdquo;

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>The Lord of Grignaulx freed his house from a ghost which
     had so tormented his wife that for the space of two years
     she had dwelt elsewhere</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      A certain Lord of Grignaulx (1) who was gentleman of honour to the Queen
      of France, Anne, Duchess of Brittany, on returning to his house whence he
      had been absent during more than two years, found his wife at another
      estate, near by, and when he inquired the reason of this, she told him
      that a ghost was wont to haunt the house, and tormented them so much that
      none could dwell there. (2) Monsieur de Grig-naulx, who had no belief in
      such absurdities, replied that were it the devil himself he was not afraid
      of him, and so brought his wife home again.
    </p>
    <p>
      At night he caused many candles to be lighted that he might see the ghost
      more clearly, and, after watching for a long time without hearing
      anything, he fell asleep; but immediately afterwards he was awaked by a
      buffet upon the cheek, and heard a voice crying, &ldquo;Brenigne, Brenigne,&rdquo;
       which had been the name of his grandmother. (3) Then he called to the
      serving-woman, who lay near them, (4) to light the candle, for all were
      now extinguished, but she durst not rise. And at the same time the Lord of
      Grig-naulx felt the covering pulled from off him, and heard a great noise
      of tables, trestles and stools falling about the room; and this lasted
      until morning. However, the Lord of Grignaulx was more displeased at
      losing his rest than afraid of the ghost, for indeed he never believed it
      to be any such thing.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  This is John de Talleyrand, knight, lord of Grignols and
     Fouquerolles, Prince of Chalais, Viscount of Fronsac, mayor
     and captain of Bordeaux, chamberlain of Charles VIII., first
     majordomo and gentleman of honour in turn to two French
     Queens, Anne of Brittany and Mary of England. His wife was
     Margaret de la Tour, daughter of Anne de la Tour, Viscount
     of Turenne, and Mary de Beaufort. She bore him several
     children. It was John de Talleyrand who warned Louise of
     Savoy that her son Francis, then Count of Angoulême, was
     paying court to the young Queen, Mary of England, wife to
     Louis XII. Apprehensive lest this intrigue should destroy
     her son&rsquo;s prospects, Louise prevailed on him to relinquish
     it (Brantôme&rsquo;s <i>Dames Illustres</i>).&mdash;L. 4 89

     2  The house haunted by the ghost would probably be
     Talleyrand&rsquo;s château at Grignols, in the department of the
     Gironde. His lordship of Fouquerolles was only a few miles
     distant, in the Dordogne, and this would be the estate to
     which his wife had retired.&mdash;Ed.

     3  Talleyrand&rsquo;s grandmother on the paternal side was Mary of
     Brabant; the reference may be to his maternal grandmother,
     whose Christian name was possibly &ldquo;Bénigne.&rdquo; On the other
     hand, Boaistuau gives the name as Revigne, and among the old
     French <i>noblesse</i> were the Revigné and Revigny families.&mdash;
     Ed.

     4  See <i>ante</i>, note 2 to Tale XXXVII.
</pre>
    <p>
      On the following night he resolved to capture this ghost, and so, when he
      had been in bed a little while, he pretended to snore very loudly, and
      placed his open hand close to his face. Whilst he was in this wise waiting
      for the ghost, he felt that something was coming near him, and accordingly
      snored yet louder than before, whereat the ghost was so encouraged as to
      deal him a mighty blow. Forthwith, the Lord of Grignaulx caught the
      ghost&rsquo;s hand as it rested on his face, and cried out to his wife&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have the ghost!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His wife immediately rose up and lit the candle, and found that it was the
      serving-woman who slept in their room; and she, throwing herself upon her
      knees, entreated forgiveness and promised to confess the truth. This was,
      that she had long loved a serving-man of the house, and had taken this
      fine mystery in hand in order to drive both master and mistress away, so
      that she and her lover, having sole charge of the house, might be able to
      make good cheer as they were wont to do when alone. My Lord of Grignaulx,
      who was a somewhat harsh man, commanded that they should be soundly beaten
      so as to prevent them from ever forgetting the ghost, and this having been
      done, they were driven away. In this fashion was the house freed from the
      plaguy ghosts who for two years long had played their pranks in it. (5)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     5  Talleyrand, who passes for having been the last of the
     &ldquo;Rois des Ribauds&rdquo; (see the Bibliophile Jacob&rsquo;s historical
     novel of that title), was, like his descendant the great
     diplomatist, a man of subtle and caustic humour. Brantôme,
     in his article on Anne of Brittany in <i>Les Dames Illustres</i>,
     repeatedly refers to him, and relates that on an occasion
     when the Queen wished to say a few words in Spanish to the
     Emperor&rsquo;s ambassador&mdash;there was a project of marrying her
     daughter Claude to Charles V.&mdash;she applied to Grignols to
     teach her a sentence or two of the Castilian language. He,
     however, taught her some dirty expression, but was careful
     to warn Louis XII., who laughed at it, telling his wife on
     no account to use the Spanish words she had learnt. On
     discovering the truth, Anne was so greatly vexed, that
     Grignols was obliged to withdraw from Court for some time,
     and only with difficulty obtained the Queen&rsquo;s forgiveness.&mdash;
     L. and Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is wonderful, ladies, to think of the effects wrought by the mighty
      god of Love. He causes women to put aside all fear, and teaches them to
      give every sort of trouble to man in order to work their own ends. But if
      the purpose of the serving-woman calls for blame, the sound sense of the
      master is no less worthy of praise. He knew that when the spirit departs,
      it returns no more.&rdquo; (6)

      &ldquo;In sooth,&rdquo; said Geburon, &ldquo;love showed little favour to the man and the
      maid, but I agree that the sound sense of the master was of great
      advantage to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; said Ennasuite, &ldquo;the maid through her cunning lived for a
      long time at her ease.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis but a sorry ease,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;that is founded upon sin and that
      ends in shame and chastisement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true, madam,&rdquo; said Ennasuite, &ldquo;but many persons reap pain and
      sorrow by living righteously, and lacking wit enough to procure themselves
      in all their lives as much pleasure as these two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is nevertheless my opinion,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;that there can be no
      perfect pleasure unless the conscience be at rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said Simontault, &ldquo;the Italian maintains that the greater the sin
      the greater the pleasure.&rdquo; (7)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     7  This may be a reference to Boccaccio or Castiglione, but
     the expression is of a proverbial character in many
     languages.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In very truth,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;he who invented such a saying must be the
      devil himself. Let us therefore say no more of him, but see to whom
      Saffredent will give his vote.&rdquo;

      yesterday to tell you why Rolandine&rsquo;s father built the castle in which he

      <i>TALE XL</i>.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>The sister of the Count of Jossebelin, after marrying
     unknown to her brother a gentleman whom he caused to be put
     to death (albeit except for his lowlier rank he had often
     desired him for his brother-in-law) did, with great patience
     and austerity of life, spend the remainder of her days in a
     hermitage</i>. (1)
</pre>
    <p>
      This lord, who was the father of Rolandine and was called the Count of
      Jossebelin, had several sisters, some of whom were married to wealthy
      husbands, others becoming nuns, whilst one, who was beyond comparison
      fairer than all the rest, dwelt unwedded in his house. (2)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  The events here narrated would have occurred in or about
     1479.&mdash;L.

     2  The so-called Count of Jossebelin is John II., Viscount
     de Rohan, previously referred to in Tale XXI. He was the son
     of Alan IX., Vicount of Rohan, by his second wife, Mary of
     Lorraine. Alan, by a first marriage with Margaret of
     Brittany, had three daughters, Jane, Margaret and Catherine,
     all three of whom were married advantageously. Contrary to
     Queen Margaret&rsquo;s assertion above, none of them became nuns;
     Alan may, however, have had illegitimate daughters who took
     the veil. By his second wife he had a son, John II., and a
     daughter christened Catherine, like her half-sister. She
     died unmarried, says Anselme&rsquo;s <i>Histoire Généalogique</i> (vol.
     iv. p. 57), and would appear to be the heroine of Queen
     Margaret&rsquo;s tale.&mdash;L. and B. J.
</pre>
    <p>
      And so dearly did she love her brother that he, for his part, preferred
      her even to his wife and children.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was asked in marriage by many of good estate, but her brother would
      never listen to them through dread of losing her, and also because he
      loved his money too well. She therefore spent a great part of her life
      un-wedded, living very virtuously in her brother&rsquo;s house. Now there was a
      young and handsome gentleman who had been reared from childhood in this
      same house, and who, growing in comeliness and virtue as well as in years,
      had come to have a complete and peaceful rule over his master, in such
      sort that whenever the latter desired to give any charge to his sister he
      always did so by means of this young gentleman, (3) and he allowed him so
      much influence and intimacy, sending him morning and evening to his
      sister, that at last a great love sprang up between the two.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     3  This is possibly a Count of Keradreux, whom John II. is
     known to have put to death, though the Breton and French
     chroniclers do not relate the circumstances of the crime.&mdash;
     See<i>post</i>, p. 100, note 4.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      But as the gentleman feared for his life if he should offend his master,
      and the lady feared also for her honour, their love found gladness in
      speech alone, until the Lord of Jossebelin had often said to his sister
      that he wished the gentleman were rich and of as good a house as her own,
      for he had never known a man whom he would so gladly have had for his
      brother-in-law.
    </p>
    <p>
      He repeated these sayings so often that, after debating them together, the
      lovers concluded that if they wedded one another they would readily be
      forgiven. Love, which easily believes what it desires, persuaded them that
      nothing but good could come of it; and in this hope they celebrated and
      consummated the marriage without the knowledge of any save a priest and
      certain women.
    </p>
    <p>
      After they had lived for a few years in the delight that man and woman can
      have together in marriage, and as one of the handsomest and most loving
      couples in Christendom, Fate, vexed to find two persons so much at their
      ease, would no longer suffer them to continue in it, but stirred up
      against them an enemy, who, keeping watch upon the lady, came to a
      knowledge of her great happiness, and, ignorant the while of her marriage,
      went and told the Lord of Jossebelin that the gentleman in whom he had so
      much trust, went too often to his sister&rsquo;s room, and that moreover at
      hours when no man should enter it. This the Count would not at first
      believe for the trust that he had in his sister and in the gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the other, like one careful for the honour of the house, repeated the
      charge so often that a strict watch was set, and the poor folk, who
      suspected nothing, were surprised. For one evening the Lord of Jossebelin
      was advised that the gentleman was with his sister, and, hastening
      thither, found the poor love-blinded pair lying in bed together. His anger
      at the sight robbed him of speech, and, drawing his sword, he ran after
      the gentleman to kill him. But the other, being nimble of body, fled in
      nothing but his shirt, and, being unable to escape by the door, leaped
      through a window into the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the poor lady, clad only in her chemise, threw herself upon her knees
      before her brother and said to him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, spare the life of my husband, for I have indeed married him; and if
      you are offended punish only me, for what he did was done at my request.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her brother, beside himself with wrath, could only reply&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even if he be your husband one hundred thousand times over, yet will I
      punish him as a rascally servant who has deceived me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he went to the window and called out loudly to kill him, which
      was speedily done before the eyes of himself and his sister. The latter,
      on beholding the pitiful sight which no prayers on her part had been able
      to prevent, spoke to her brother like a woman bereft of reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I have neither father nor mother, and I am old
      enough to marry according to my own pleasure. I chose one whom many a time
      you said you would gladly have me marry, and for doing by your own
      counsels that which the law permits me to do without them, you have put to
      death the man whom you loved best of all the world. Well, since my prayers
      have been of no avail to preserve his life, I implore you, by all the love
      you have ever borne me, to make me now a sharer in his death even as I
      have been a sharer in all his living fortunes. In this way, while sating
      your unjust and cruel anger, you will give repose to the body and soul of
      one who cannot and will not live without him.&rdquo; Although her brother was
      almost distracted with passion, (4) he had pity upon his sister, and so,
      without granting or denying her request, withdrew. After weighing well
      what he had done, and hearing that the gentleman had in fact married his
      sister, he would gladly have undone his grievous crime. Nevertheless,
      being afraid that his sister would seek justice or vengeance for it, he
      caused a castle to be built in the midst of a forest, (5) and, placing her
      therein, forbade that any should have speech with her.

     4  John II. of Rohan was a man of the most passionate,
     resentful disposition, and the greater part of his life was
     spent in furthering ambitious schemes, stirring up feuds and
     factions, and desolating Brittany with civil war. In 1470 we
     find him leaving the service of the Duke, his master, to
     enter that of Louis XI., on whose side he fought till the
     peace of Senlis in 1475. Four years later the Duke of
     Brittany caused him to be arrested on the charge of
     murdering the Count of Keradreux, and he appears to have
     remained in prison till 1484, when it is recorded that he
     fled to France, and thence to Lorraine. In 1487 he leagued
     himself with several discontented nobles to drive away the
     Chancellor of Brittany and various foreign favourites around
     the Duke, and carried civil war into several parts of the
     duchy. Then for a brief space he made his peace with the
     Duke, but again took up arms for the French King, fought at
     St. Aubin du Cormier, captured Dinan and besieged and
     pillaged Guingamp. Charles VIII. appointed him Lieutenant-
     general of Lower Brittany in 1491, and he was first
     commissary of the King of France at the States of Brittany
     held at Vannes in 1491 and 1501. In 1507 he witnessed the
     marriage contract of the Princess Claude with Francis, Duke
     of Valois, afterwards Francis I. (Anselme&rsquo;s <i>Histoire
     Généalogique</i>, vol. iv. p. 57). When Anne became Duchess of
     Brittany, John II. vainly strove to compel her to marry his
     son, James, and this was one of the causes of their life-
     long enmity (<i>ante</i> vol. iii. Tale XXI.) John II. died in
     1516.&mdash;L. and Ed.

     5  If this be the chateau of Josselin, as some previous
     commentators think, Queen Margaret is in error here, for
     records subsist which prove that Josselin, now classed among
     the historical monuments of France, was built not by John
     II., but by his father, Alan IX. It rises on a steep rock on
     the bank of the Oust, at nine miles from Ploèrmel, and on
     the sculptured work, both inside and out, the letters A. V.
     (Alan, Viscount) are frequently repeated, with the arms of
     Rohan and Brittany quartered together, and bearing the proud
     device <i>A plus</i>. It seems to us evident that the incidents
     recorded in the early part of Queen Margaret&rsquo;s tale took
     place at Josselin, and that Catherine de Rohan was
     imprisoned in some other chateau expressly erected by her
     brother.&mdash;D. and Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      Some time afterwards he sought, for the satisfaction of his conscience, to
      win her back again, and spoke to her of marriage; but she sent him word
      that he had given her too sorry a breakfast to make her willing to sup off
      the same dish, and that she looked to live in such sort that he should
      never murder a second husband of hers; for, she added, she could scarcely
      believe that he would forgive another man after having so cruelly used the
      one whom he had loved best of all the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      And although weak and powerless for revenge, she placed her hopes in Him
      who is the true Judge, and who suffers no wickedness to go unpunished;
      and, relying upon His love alone, was minded to spend the rest of her life
      in her hermitage. And this she did, for she never stirred from that place
      so long as she lived, but dwelt there with such patience and austerity
      that her tomb was visited by every one as that of a saint.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the time that she died, her brother&rsquo;s house came to such a ruinous
      state, that of his six sons not one was left, but all died miserably; (6)
      and at last the inheritance, as you heard in the former story, passed into
      the possession of Rolandine, who succeeded to the prison that had been
      built for her aunt.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     6  Queen Margaret is in error here. Instead of six sons,
     John II., according to the most reliable genealogical
     accounts of the Rohan family, had but two, James, Viscount
     of Rohan and Lord of Leon, who died childless in 1527, and
     Claud, Bishop of Cornouailles, who succeeded him as Viscount
     of Rohan (Anselme). These had two sisters, Anne, the
     Rolandine of Tale XXI., and Mary, who died in June 1542
     (Dillaye).&mdash;Ed.

    <p>
      &ldquo;I pray God, ladies, that this example may be profitable to you, and that
      none among you will seek to marry for her own pleasure without the consent
      of those to whom obedience is due; for marriage is a state of such long
      continuance that it should not be entered upon lightly and without the
      advice of friends and kin. And, indeed, however wisely one may act, there
      is always at least as much pain in it as there is pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In good faith,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;were there neither God nor law to teach
      maidens discretion, this example would suffice to give them more reverence
      for their kindred, and not to seek marriage according to their own
      pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still, madam,&rdquo; said Nomerfide, &ldquo;whoso has but one good day in the year,
      is not unhappy her whole life long. She had the pleasure of seeing and
      speaking for a long time with him whom she loved better than herself, and
      she moreover enjoyed the delights of marriage with him without scruple of
      conscience. I consider such happiness so great, that in my opinion it
      surpassed the sorrow that she bore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You maintain, then,&rdquo; said Saffredent, &ldquo;that a woman has more pleasure in
      lying with a husband, than pain in seeing him put to death before her
      eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not my meaning,&rdquo; said Nomerfide, &ldquo;for it would be contrary to my
      experience of women. But I hold that an unwonted pleasure such as that of
      marrying the man whom one loves best of all the world, must be greater
      than that of losing him by death, which is common to all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Geburon, &ldquo;if the death be a natural one, but that in the story
      was too cruel. And I think it very strange, considering he was neither her
      father nor her husband but only her brother, and she had reached an age
      when the law suffers maidens to marry according to their own pleasure,
      that this lord should have had the daring to commit so cruel a deed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not think it at all strange,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;for he did not kill his
      sister whom he dearly loved, and who was not subject to his control, but
      dealt with the gentleman whom he had bred as his son and loved as his
      brother. He had bestowed honour and wealth upon him in his service, and in
      return for all this the other sought his sister in marriage, a thing which
      was in nowise fitting for him to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Moreover,&rdquo; said Nomerfide, &ldquo;it was no ordinary or wonted pleasure for a
      lady of such high lineage to marry a gentleman servant for love. If the
      death was extraordinary, the pleasure also was novel, and it was the
      greater seeing that it had against it the opinions of all wise folk, for
      it was the happiness of a loving heart with tranquillity of soul, since
      God was in no wise offended by it And as for the death that you call
      cruel, it seems to me that, since death is unavoidable, the swifter it
      comes the better; for we know that it is a road by which all of us must
      travel. I deem those fortunate who do not long linger on the outksirts of
      death, but who take a speedy flight from all that can be termed happiness
      in this world to the happiness that is eternal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by the outskirts of death?&rdquo; said Simontault.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such as have deep tribulation of spirit,&rdquo; replied Nomerfide, &ldquo;such, too,
      as have long been ill, and in their extreme bodily or spiritual pain have
      come to think lightly of death and find its approach too slow, such, I
      say, as these have passed through the outskirts of death and will tell you
      of the hostels where they knew more lamentation than rest. The lady of the
      story could not help losing her husband through death, but her brother&rsquo;s
      wrath preserved her from seeing him a long time sick or distressed in
      mind. And turning the gladness that she had had with him to the service of
      Our Lord, she might well esteem herself happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you make no account,&rdquo; said Longarine, &ldquo;of the shame that she endured,
      or of her imprisonment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I consider,&rdquo; said Nomerfide, &ldquo;that a woman who lives perfectly, with a
      love that is in keeping with the commands of her God, has no knowledge of
      shame or dishonour except when they impair or lessen the perfection of her
      love; for the glory of truly loving knows no shame. As for her
      imprisonment, I imagine that, with her heart at large and devoted to God
      and her husband, she thought nothing of it, but deemed her solitude the
      greatest freedom. When one cannot see what one loves, the greatest
      happiness consists in thinking constantly upon it, and there is no prison
      so narrow that thought cannot roam in it at will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing can be truer than what Nomerfide says,&rdquo; observed Simontault, &ldquo;but
      the man who in his passion brought this separation to pass must have
      deemed himself unhappy indeed, seeing that he offended God, Love and
      Honour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In good sooth,&rdquo; said Geburon, &ldquo;I am amazed at the diversity of woman&rsquo;s
      love. I can see that those who have most love have most virtue; but those
      who have less love conceal it in their desire to appear virtuous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;that a heart which is virtuous towards God
      and man loves more deeply than a vicious one, and fears not to have its
      inmost purpose known.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have always heard,&rdquo; said Simontault, &ldquo;that men should not be blamed if
      they seek the love of women, for God has put into the heart of man desire
      and boldness for asking, and in that of woman fear and chastity for
      refusal. If, then, a man be punished for using the powers that have been
      given him, he suffers wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it must be remembered,&rdquo; said Longarine, &ldquo;that he had praised this
      gentleman for a long time to his sister. It seems to me that it would be
      madness or cruelty in the keeper of a fountain to praise its fair waters
      to one fainting with thirst, and then to kill him when he sought to taste
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The brother,&rdquo; thereupon said Parlamente, &ldquo;did indeed so kindle the flame
      by gentle words of his own, that it was not meet he should beat it out
      with the sword.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am surprised,&rdquo; said Saffredent, &ldquo;to find it taken ill that a simple
      gentleman should by dint of love alone, and without deceit, have come to
      marry a lady of high lineage, seeing that the wisdom of the philosophers
      accounts the least of men to be of more worth than the greatest and most
      virtuous of women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The reason is,&rdquo; said Dagoucin, &ldquo;that in order to preserve the
      commonwealth in peace, account is only taken of the rank of families, the
      age of persons, and the provisions of the laws, without regard to the love
      and virtue of individuals, and all this so that the kingdom may not be
      disturbed. Hence it comes to pass that, in marriages made between equals
      and according to the judgment of kinsfolk and society, the husband and
      wife often journey to the very outskirts of hell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed it has been seen,&rdquo; said Geburon, &ldquo;that those who, being alike in
      heart, character and temperament, have married for love and paid no heed
      to diversity of birth and lineage, have ofttime sorely repented of it; for
      a deep unreasoning love is apt to turn to jealousy and rage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;that neither course is worthy of
      praise, but that folks should submit themselves to the will of God, and
      pay no heed to glory, avarice or pleasure, and loving virtuously and with
      the approval of their kinsfolk, seek only to live in the married state as
      God and nature ordain. And although no condition be free from tribulation,
      I have nevertheless seen such persons live together without regret; and we
      of this company are not so unfortunate as to have none of these married
      ones among the number.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hircan, Geburon, Simontault and Saffredent swore that they had wedded
      after this sort, and had never repented since. Whatever the truth of this
      declaration may have been, the ladies concerned were exceedingly content
      with it, and thinking that they could hear nothing to please them better,
      they rose up to go and give thanks for it to God, and found the monks at
      the church, ready for vespers.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the service was over they went to supper, but not without much
      discourse concerning their marriages; and this lasted all the evening,
      each one relating the fortune that had befallen him whilst he was wooing
      his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it happened, however, that one was interrupted by another, it is not
      possible to set down these stories in full, albeit they would have been as
      pleasant to write as those which had been told in the meadow. Such great
      delight did they take in the converse, and so well did it entertain them,
      that, before they were aware of it, the hour for rest had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lady Oisille made the company separate, and they betook themselves to
      bed so joyously that, what with recounting the loves of the past, and
      proving those of the present, the married folk, methinks, slept no longer
      than the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so the night was pleasantly spent until the morning.

      PROLOGUE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When morning was come, the Lady Oisille made ready for them a spiritual
      breakfast of such excellent flavour that it sufficed to strengthen both
      body and mind. The whole company was very attentive to it; it seemed to
      them that they had never harkened to a sermon with such profit before.
      Then, when the last bell rang for mass, they went to meditate upon the
      pious discourse which they had heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      After listening to mass, and walking for a little while, they went to
      table feeling assured that the present day would prove as agreeable as any
      of the past. Saffredent even said that he would gladly have the bridge
      building for another month, so great was the pleasure that he took in
      their entertainment; but the Abbot was pressing the work with all speed,
      for it was no pleasure to him to live in the company of so many honourable
      persons, among whom he could not bring his wonted female pilgrims.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having rested for a time after dinner, they returned to their accustomed
      diversion. When all were seated in the meadow, they asked Parlamente to
      whom she gave her vote.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;that Saffredent might well begin this day, for
      his face does not look as though he wished us to weep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, ladies, you will needs be very hard-hearted,&rdquo; said Saffredent, &ldquo;if
      you take no pity on the Grey Friar whose story I am going to relate to
      you. You may perhaps think, from the tales that some among us have already
      told of the monks, that misadventures have befallen hapless damsels simply
      because ease of execution induced the attempt to be fearlessly begun, but,
      so that you may know that it is the blindness of wanton lust which
      deprives the friars of all fear and prudence, I will tell you of what
      happened to one of them in Flanders.&rdquo;

      Louise of Savoy, (1) the said Lady Margaret had in her train the Countess

     chamberlain to the Emperor Charles V. They were the parents
     of the famous Lamoral Count of Egmont, Prince of Gavre and
     Baron of Fiennes, born in 1522 and put to death by the Duke
     of Alba on June 5, 1568.&mdash;B.J.
</pre>
    <p>
      When this great assembly separated, the Countess of Aiguemont returned to
      her own house, and, Advent being come, sent to a monastery of Grey Friars
      to ask for a clever preacher and virtuous man, as well to preach as to
      confess herself and her whole household. The Warden, remembering the great
      benefits that the Order received from the house of Aiguemont and that of
      Fiennes, to which the Countess belonged, sought out the man whom he
      thought most worthy to fill the said office.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, as the Grey Friars more than any other order desire to obtain
      the esteem and friendship of great houses, they sent the most important
      preacher of their monastery, and throughout Advent he did his duty very
      well, and the Countess was well pleased with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Christmas night, when the Countess desired to receive her Creator, she
      sent for her confessor, and after making confession in a carefully closed
      chapel, she gave place to her lady of honour, who in her turn, after being
      shriven, sent her daughter to pass through the hands of this worthy
      confessor. When the maiden had told all that was in her mind, the good
      father knew something of her secrets, and this gave him the desire and the
      boldness to lay an unwonted penance upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My daughter,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;your sins are so great that to atone for them I
      command you the penance of wearing my cord upon your naked flesh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The maiden, who was unwilling to disobey him, made answer&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give it to me, father, and I will not fail to wear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My daughter,&rdquo; said the good father, &ldquo;it will be of no avail from your own
      hand. Mine, from which you shall receive absolution, must first bind it
      upon you; then shall you be absolved of all your sins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The maiden replied, weeping, that she would not suffer it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; said the confessor. &ldquo;Are you a heretic, that you refuse the
      penances which God and our holy mother Church have ordained?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I employ confession,&rdquo; said the maiden, &ldquo;as the Church commands, and I am
      very willing to receive absolution and do penance. But I will not be
      touched by your hands, and I refuse this mode of penance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the confessor, &ldquo;I cannot give you absolution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The maiden rose from before him greatly troubled in conscience, for, being
      very young, she feared lest she had done wrong in thus refusing to obey
      the worthy father.
    </p>
    <p>
      When mass was over and the Countess of Aiguemont had received the &ldquo;Corpus
      Domini,&rdquo; her lady of honour, desiring to follow her, asked her daughter
      whether she was ready. The maiden, weeping, replied that she was not
      shriven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what were you doing so long with the preacher?&rdquo; asked her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said the maiden, &ldquo;for, as I refused the penance that he laid
      upon me, he on his part refused me absolution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Making prudent inquiry, the mother learnt the extraordinary penance that
      the good father had chosen for her daughter; and then, having caused her
      to be confessed by another, they received the sacrament together. When the
      Countess was come back from the church, the lady of honour made complaint
      to her of the preacher, whereupon the Countess was the more surprised and
      grieved, since she had thought so well of him. Nevertheless, despite her
      anger, she could not but feel very much inclined to laugh at the unwonted
      nature of the penance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still her laughter did not prevent her from having the friar taken and
      beaten in her kitchen, where he was brought by the strokes of the rod to
      confess the truth; and then she sent him bound hand and foot to his
      Warden, begging the latter for the future to commission more virtuous men
      to preach the Word of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Consider, ladies, if the monks be not afraid to display their wantonness
      in so illustrious a house, what may they not do in the poor places where
      they commonly make their collections, and where opportunities are so
      readily offered to them, that it is a miracle if they are quit of them
      without scandal. And this, ladies, leads me to beg of you to change your
      ill opinion into compassion, remembering that he (3) who blinds the Grey
      Friars is not sparing of the ladies when he finds an opportunity.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     3  The demon.&mdash;B. J.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;this was a very wicked Grey Friar. A monk, a
      priest and a preacher to work such wickedness, and that on Christmas day,
      in the church and under the cloak of the confessional&mdash;all these are
      circumstances which heighten the sin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would seem from your words,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;that the Grey Friars ought
      to be angels, or more discreet than other men, but you have heard
      instances enough to show you that they are far worse. As for the monk in
      the story, I think he might well be excused, seeing that he found himself
      shut up all alone at night with a handsome girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;but it was Christmas night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That makes him still less to blame,&rdquo; said Simontault, &ldquo;for, being in
      Joseph&rsquo;s place beside a fair virgin, he wished to try to beget an infant
      and so play the Mystery of the Nativity to the life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In sooth,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;if he had thought of Joseph and the Virgin
      Mary, he would have had no such evil purpose. At all events, he was a
      wickedly-minded man to make so evil an attempt upon such slight
      provocation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;that the Countess punished him well enough to
      afford an excellent example to his fellows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But &lsquo;tis questionable,&rdquo; said Nomerfide, &ldquo;whether she did well in thus
      putting her neighbour to shame, or whether &lsquo;twould not have been better to
      have quietly shown him his faults, rather than have made them so publicly
      known.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would, I think, have been better,&rdquo; said Geburon, &ldquo;for we are
      commanded to rebuke our neighbour in secret, before we speak of the matter
      to any one else or to the Church. When a man has been brought to public
      disgrace, he will hardly ever be able to mend his ways, but fear of shame
      withdraws as many persons from sin as conscience does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;that we ought to observe the teaching of the
      Gospel towards all except those that preach the Word of God and act
      contrary to it. We should not be afraid to shame such as are accustomed to
      put others to shame; indeed I think it a very meritorious thing to make
      them known for what they really are, so that we take not a mock stone (4)
      for a fine ruby. But to whom will Saffredent give his vote?&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     4  The French word here is <i>doublet</i>. The doublet was a
     piece of crystal, cut after the fashion of a diamond, and
     backed with red wax so as to give it somewhat the colour of
     a ruby.&mdash;B. J.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since you ask me,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I will give it to yourself, to whom no
      man of understanding should refuse it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, since you give it to me, I will tell you a story to the truth of
      which I can myself testify. I have always heard that when virtue abides in
      a weak and feeble vessel, and is assailed by its strong and puissant
      opposite, it especially deserves praise, and shows itself to be what it
      really is. If strength withstand strength, it is no very wonderful thing;
      but if weakness win the victory, it is lauded by every one. Knowing, as I
      do, the persons of whom I desire to speak, I think that I should do a
      wrong to virtue, (which I have often seen hidden under so mean a covering
      that none gave it any heed), if I did not tell of her who performed the
      praiseworthy actions that I now feel constrained to relate.&rdquo;

      <i>TALE XLII</i>.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>A young Prince set his affections upon a young girl, and
     although she was of low and poor parentage, he could not, in
     spite of all his efforts, obtain from her what he had hoped
     to have. Accordingly, recognising her virtue and honour, the
     Prince desisted from his attempt, esteemed her highly all
     his life, and, marrying her to a follower of his own,
     bestowed great benefits upon her</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      In one of the best towns in Touraine there dwelt a lord of illustrious
      family, who had there been brought up from early youth. Of the
      perfections, graces, beauty and great virtues of this young Prince (1) I
      will say nothing, except that in his time his equal could not be found.
      Being fifteen years of age, he had more pleasure in hunting and hawking
      than in looking at beautiful ladies.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  This is undoubtedly Francis I., then Count of Angoulême.
     M. de Lincy thinks that the scene of the story must be
     Amboise, where Louise of Savoy went to live with her
     children in 1499, and remained for several years; Louis XII.
     having placed the château there at her disposal. Francis,
     however, left Amboise to join the Court at Blois in August
     1508, when less than fourteen years old (see Memoir of Queen
     Margaret, vol. i. p. xxiii.), and in the tale, above, he is
     said to have been fifteen at the time of the incidents
     narrated. These, then, would have occurred in the autumn of
     1509. It will be seen that in the tale the young Prince&rsquo;s
     sister (Margaret) is described as residing at the castle.
     Now Margaret married Charles of Alençon at Blois, in October
     1509, and forthwith removed to Alençon. Possibly Francis,
     who was very precocious, especially in matters of gallantry,
     engaged in the love affair narrated by his sister at a yet
     earlier age than she asserts, in which case the town she
     refers to would undoubtedly be Amboise.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      One day in a church he beheld a young maiden who formerly, during her
      childhood, had been bred in the castle where he dwelt; but after her
      mother&rsquo;s death, her father having married again, she had withdrawn into
      Poitou with her brother. This maiden, who was called Frances, had a
      bastard sister whom her father dearly loved, and whom he had married to
      the young Prince&rsquo;s butler, who maintained her in as excellent a condition
      as that of any of her family. It came to pass that the father died and
      left to Frances as her portion what he possessed near the town
      aforementioned, and thither she returned after his death; nevertheless,
      being unmarried and only sixteen years of age, she would not live alone in
      her house, but went to lodge with her sister, the butler&rsquo;s wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      On perceiving this girl, who was passably beautiful for a light brunette,
      and possessed a grace beyond her condition (for, indeed, she seemed rather
      a lady or princess than a towns-woman), the young Prince gazed at her for
      a long time, and he, who never yet had loved, now felt in his heart an
      unwonted delight. On returning to his apartment he inquired concerning the
      maiden he had seen in the church, and then recollected that formerly in
      her youth she had come to the castle to have dolls&rsquo; play with his sister.
      He reminded the latter of her; and his sister sent for her, received her
      kindly, and begged her to come often to see her. This she did whenever
      there was a feast or entertainment; and the young Prince was so pleased to
      see her that he had in mind to be deeply in love with her, and, knowing
      her to be of low and poor parentage, hoped easily to obtain what he
      sought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having no means of speaking with her, he sent a gentleman of his chamber
      to her to conduct his intrigue. But she, being discreet and fearing God,
      told the gentleman that she did not believe so handsome and honourable a
      Prince as his master could have pleasure in looking upon one so ugly as
      herself, since he had so many beautiful ladies in the castle where he
      lived, that he had no need to search through the town; and she added that
      in her opinion the gentleman was speaking of his own authority, and
      without his master&rsquo;s command.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the young Prince received this reply, love, which becomes the more
      eager the more it meets with resistance, caused him to pursue his
      enterprise more hotly than before, and to write her a letter in which he
      begged that she would believe all the gentleman had told her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being well able to read and write, she read the letter through, but, in
      spite of all the gentleman&rsquo;s entreaties, she would never send an answer to
      it. It was not for one of such low degree, she said, to write to so noble
      a Prince, and she begged the gentleman not to deem her foolish enough to
      believe that the Prince had so much love for her. Moreover, he was
      deceived if he thought that he could have her at his will by reason of her
      humble condition; for her heart was as virtuous as that of the greatest
      Princess in Christendom, and she looked upon all the treasures in the
      world as naught in comparison with honour and a good conscience. She
      therefore entreated him not to try to hinder her from keeping these
      treasures safe her whole life long, for she would never change her mind
      even were she threatened with death.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young Prince did not find this reply to his liking, nevertheless he
      loved her dearly for it, and never failed to have his chair set in the
      church to which she went to hear mass, where, during the service, he would
      ever turn his eyes upon the same image. When she perceived this, she
      changed her place and went to another chapel&mdash;not indeed to flee the
      sight of him, for she would not have been a reasonable being had she not
      found pleasure in beholding him&mdash;but because she dreaded to be seen
      by him. She did not deem herself worthy to be loved by him in honour or
      marriage, and, on the other hand, she would not be loved wantonly and for
      pleasure. When she found that, in whatever part of the church she placed
      herself, the Prince heard mass close by, she would no longer go to the
      same church, but repaired every day to the remotest that she could find.
      And when there was feasting at the castle, although the Prince&rsquo;s sister
      often sent for her, she would no longer go thither, but excused herself on
      the plea of sickness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finding that he could not have speech with her, the Prince had recourse to
      his butler, and promised him great rewards if he would lend assistance in
      the matter. This the butler, for the sake both of pleasing his master and
      of the gain that he expected, readily promised to do. Every day he would
      relate to the Prince what she said or did, telling him that she was
      especially careful to shun all opportunities of seeing him. However, the
      great desire that the Prince had of speaking with her at his ease,
      prompted him to devise the following plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day he took his chargers, which he was beginning to manage excellently
      well, to a large open space in the town opposite to his butler&rsquo;s house, in
      which Frances lived. After making many courses and leaps which she could
      easily see, he let himself fall from his horse into some deep mire, but so
      softly that he was not hurt. Nevertheless he uttered passably loud groans,
      and asked whether there was a house near in which he might change his
      dress. Every one offered his own, but on some one saying that the butler&rsquo;s
      was the nearest and worthiest, it was chosen before all the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found the room well furnished, and, as all his garments were soiled
      with the mud, he stripped himself to his shirt, and got into a bed. Then,
      when he saw that, except the gentleman aforementioned, every one was gone
      to bring him some clothes, he called his host and hostess and asked them
      where Frances was. They had much ado to find her, for, as soon as she had
      seen the young Prince coming in, she had gone to hide herself in the most
      retired nook in the house. Nevertheless her sister found her, and begged
      her not to be afraid to speak to so worshipful and virtuous a Prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! sister,&rdquo; said Frances, &ldquo;do you, whom I look upon as my mother,
      advise me to go and speak with a young lord, of whose purpose, as you are
      aware, I cannot be ignorant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      However, her sister addressed so many remonstrances to her, and promised
      so often not to leave her alone, that she at last went with her, showing
      so pale and sorry a face that she seemed more likely to beget compassion
      than desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the young Prince saw her by his bedside, he took hold of her hand,
      which was cold and trembling, and said to her&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frances, do you deem me so wicked a man, and so strange and cruel, that I
      eat the women I look upon? Why have you come to be so afraid of me who
      seek only your honour and profit? You know that I have sought to hold
      converse with you in all possible places, but all in vain; and, to grieve
      me still more, you have even shunned the places where I had been wont to
      see you at mass, so that my eyes might bring me as little gladness as my
      tongue. But all this has availed you naught, for I have never rested until
      I came hither in the manner you have seen, and I have risked my neck, in
      allowing myself to fall, in order that I might have the joy of speaking to
      you without hindrance. I therefore entreat you, Frances, that the
      opportunity gained by so much toil may not be thrown away, and that my
      deep love may avail to win your own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After waiting a long time for her reply, and seeing that her eyes were
      full of tears and fixed upon the ground, he drew her to him as closely as
      he could, and tried to embrace and kiss her. But she said to him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my lord, no; what you desire cannot be, for although I am but a worm
      of the earth compared with you, I hold my honour dear, and would rather
      die than lessen it for any pleasure that the world can give. And the dread
      I have lest those who have seen you come in should suspect the truth,
      makes me tremble and be afraid as you see. And, since it pleases you to do
      me the honour of speaking to me, you will also forgive me if I answer you
      according as my honour requires. I am not so foolish, my lord, nor so
      blind as not to perceive and recognise the comeliness and grace that God
      has given you, or not to consider that she who shall possess the person
      and love of such a Prince must be the happiest woman alive. But what does
      all this avail me, since it is not for me or any woman of my condition,
      and since even to long for it would, in me, be utter folly? What reason
      can I believe to be yours in addressing yourself to me except that the
      ladies in your house, whom you must love if you have any love for beauty
      and grace, are so virtuous that you dare not seek or expect from them what
      the lowliness of my condition has led you to expect from me? I am sure
      that if you obtained your desire from one such as I, it would afford
      matter for entertainment to your mistress during two good hours, to hear
      you tell her of your conquests over the weak. But, my lord, be pleased to
      bear in mind that I shall never be of their number. I have been brought up
      in your house, where I have learned what it is to love; my father and my
      mother were your faithful servants. Since, therefore, God has not made me
      a Princess to marry you, nor of sufficient rank to be your mistress and
      love, you will be pleased not to try to number me with the unfortunate,
      seeing that I deem and would have you to be one of the happiest Princes in
      Christendom. If for diversion you would have women of my condition, you
      will find in this town many who are beyond compare more beautiful than I,
      and who will spare you the pains of so many entreaties. Content yourself,
      then, with those to whom you will give pleasure by the purchase of their
      honour, and cease to trouble one who loves you more than she loves
      herself. For, indeed, if either your life or mine were required of God
      this day, I should esteem myself fortunate in offering mine to save yours.
      It is no lack of love that makes me shun your presence, but rather too
      great a love for your conscience and mine; for I hold my honour dearer
      than life. I will continue, my lord, if it please you, in your good grace,
      and will all my life pray God for your health and prosperity. And truly
      the honour that you have done me will lend me consideration among those of
      my own rank, for, after seeing you, where is the man of my own condition
      upon whom I could deign to look? So my heart will continue free save for
      the duty which shall always be mine of praying to God on your behalf. But
      no other service can you ever have of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On hearing this virtuous reply, contrary though it was to his desires, the
      young Prince could not but esteem her as she deserved. He did all that he
      could to persuade her that he would never love another woman, but she was
      too prudent to suffer so unreasonable a thought to enter her mind. While
      they were talking together, word was often brought that his clothes were
      come from the castle, but such was his present pleasure and comfort, that
      he caused answer to be given that he was asleep. And this continued until
      the hour for supper was come, when he durst not fail to appear before his
      mother, who was one of the discreetest ladies imaginable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, the young man left his butler&rsquo;s house thinking more highly
      than ever of the maiden&rsquo;s virtue. He often spoke of her to the gentleman
      that slept in his room, and the latter, who deemed money to be more
      powerful than love, advised his master to offer her a considerable sum if
      she would yield to his wishes. The young Prince, whose mother was his
      treasurer, had but little money for his pocket, but, borrowing as much as
      he was able, he made up the sum of five hundred crowns, which he sent by
      the gentleman to the girl, begging her to change her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, when she saw the gift, she said to the gentleman&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pray you tell my lord that I have a good and virtuous heart, and that
      if it were meet to obey his commands his comeliness and grace would ere
      now have vanquished me; but, since these have no power against my honour,
      all the money in the world can have none. Take it, therefore, back to him
      again, for I would rather enjoy virtuous poverty than all the wealth it
      were possible to desire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On beholding so much stubbornness, the gentleman thought that violence
      must needs be used to win her, and threatened her with his master&rsquo;s
      authority and power. But she laughed, and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make those fear him who have no knowledge of him. For my part, I know him
      to be so discreet and virtuous that such discourse cannot come from him,
      and I feel sure that he will disown it when you repeat it to him. But even
      though he were what you say, there is neither torment nor death that would
      make me change my mind; for, as I have told you, since love has not turned
      my heart, no imaginable evil or good can divert me one step from the path
      that I have chosen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman, who had promised his master to win her, brought him back
      this reply in wondrous anger, and counselled him to persevere in every
      possible way, telling him that it was not to his honour to be unable to
      win a woman of her sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young Prince was unwilling to employ any means but such as honour
      enjoins, and was also afraid that if the affair made any noise, and so
      came to his mother&rsquo;s ears, she would be greatly angered with him. He
      therefore durst make no attempt, until at last the gentleman proposed to
      him so simple a plan that he could already fancy her to be in his power.
      In order to carry it into execution he spoke to the butler; and he, being
      anxious to serve his master in any way that might be, begged his wife and
      sister-in-law one day to go and visit their vintages at a house he had
      near the forest. And this they promised to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the day was come, he informed the Prince, who resolved to go thither
      alone with the gentleman, and caused his mule to be secretly held in
      readiness, that they might set out at the proper time. But God willed it
      that his mother should that day be garnishing a most beautiful cabinet,
      (2) and needed all her children with her to help her, and thus the young
      Prince lingered there until the hour was past.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was, however, no hindrance to the departure of the butler, who had
      brought his sister-in-law to his house, riding behind him, (3) and had
      made his wife feign sickness, so that when they were already on horseback
      she had come and said that she could not go with them. But now, seeing
      that the hour at which the Prince should have come was gone by, he said to
      his sister-in-law&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we may now return to the town.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     2  The French word here is <i>cabinet</i>, which some English
     translators have rendered as &ldquo;little room.&rdquo; We think,
     however, with the Bibliophile Jacob, that the allusion is to
     an article of furniture, such as we ourselves still call a
     cabinet in England, though in France the word has virtually
     lost that sense.&mdash;Ed.

     3  The MSS. do not say whether she rode on a pillion, or
     simply bestrode the horse. This last fashion was still
     common at this period and long afterwards, even among women
     of high degree. See, for instance, several of the enamels in
     the Louvre, notably one which depicts Henry II. of France
     with Diana of Poitiers riding behind him. The practice is
     also referred to in a sixteenth century ballad. &ldquo;La
     Superfluity des habitz des Dames&rdquo; (<i>Anciennes Poésies
     Françaises</i>. Bib. Elzev. 1858, p. 308).&mdash;M.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is there to hinder us from doing so?&rdquo; asked Frances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said the butler, &ldquo;I was waiting here for my lord, who had promised
      me that he would come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When his sister-in-law heard this wickedness, she replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not wait for him, brother, for I know that he will not come to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The brother-in-law believed her and brought her back again, and when she
      had reached home she let him know her extreme anger, telling him that he
      was the devil&rsquo;s servant, and did yet more than he was commanded, for she
      was sure that the plan had been devised by him and the gentleman and not
      by the young Prince, whose money he would rather earn by aiding him in his
      follies, than by doing the duty of a good servant. However, now that she
      knew his real nature, she would remain no longer in his house, and
      thereupon indeed she sent for her brother to take her to his own country,
      and immediately left her sister&rsquo;s dwelling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having thus failed in his attempt, the butler went to the castle to learn
      what had prevented the arrival of the young Prince, and he had scarcely
      come thither when he met the Prince himself sallying forth on his mule,
      and attended only by the gentleman in whom he put so much trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; the Prince asked of him, &ldquo;is she still there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon the butler related all that had taken place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young Prince was deeply vexed at having failed in his plan, which he
      looked upon as the very last that he could devise, but, seeing that it
      could not be helped, he sought out Frances so diligently that at last he
      met her in a gathering from which she could not escape. He then upbraided
      her very harshly for her cruelty towards him, and for having left her
      brother-in-law, but she made answer that the latter was, in regard to
      herself, the worst and most dangerous man she had ever known, though he,
      the Prince, was greatly beholden to him, seeing that he was served by him
      not only with body and substance, but with soul and conscience as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Prince perceived by this that the case was a hopeless one, he
      resolved to urge her no more, and esteemed her highly all his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing this maiden&rsquo;s goodness, one of the said Prince&rsquo;s attendants desired
      to marry her, but to this she would not consent without the command and
      license of the young Prince, upon whom she had set all her affection; and
      this she caused to be made known to him, and with his approval the
      marriage was concluded. And so she lived all her life in good repute, and
      the young Prince bestowed great benefits upon her. (4)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     4  We take this concluding paragraph from MS. 1520; it is
     deficient in ours.&mdash;L.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall we say to this, ladies? Have we hearts so base as to make our
      servants our masters&mdash;seeing that this woman was not to be subdued
      either by love or torment? Let us, I pray you, take example by her conduct
      and conquer ourselves, for this is the most meritorious conquest that we
      can make.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see but one thing to be regretted,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;which is that these
      virtuous actions did not take place in the days of the old historians.
      Those who gave so much praise to their Lucretia would have neglected her
      to set down at length the virtues of this maiden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are indeed so great,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;that, were it not for the solemn
      vow that we have taken to speak the truth, I could not believe her to have
      been what you describe. We have often seen sick persons turn in disgust
      from good and wholesome meats to eat such as are bad and hurtful, and in
      the same way this girl may have had some gentleman of her own estate for
      whose sake she despised all nobility.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But to this Parlemente replied that the girl&rsquo;s whole life showed that she
      had never loved any living man save him whom she loved more than her very
      life, though not more than her honour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put that notion out of your head,&rdquo; said Saffredent, &ldquo;and learn the origin
      of the term &lsquo;honour&rsquo; as used among women; for perhaps those that speak so
      much of it are ignorant of how the name was devised. Know then that in the
      earliest times, when there was but little wickedness among men, love was
      so frank and strong that it was never concealed, and he who loved the most
      perfectly received most praise. But when greed and sinfulness fastened
      upon heart and honour, they drove out God and love, and in their place set
      up selfishness, hypocrisy and deceit. Then, when some ladies found that
      they fostered in their hearts the virtue of true love but that the word
      &lsquo;hypocrisy&rsquo; was hateful among men, they adopted instead the word &lsquo;honour.&rsquo;
      At last, too, even those who could feel no honourable love said that
      &lsquo;honour&rsquo; forbade them, and cruelly made this a law for all, so that now
      even those who love perfectly use concealment, holding virtue for a vice.
      But such as have an excellent understanding and a sound judgment never
      fall into any such error. They know the difference between darkness and
      light, and are aware that true honour consists in manifesting the purity
      of their hearts, (which should live upon love alone), and not in priding
      themselves on the vice of dissimulation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet,&rdquo; said Dagoucin, &ldquo;it is said that the most secret love is the most
      worthy of praise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, secret,&rdquo; said Simontault, &ldquo;from the eyes of those who might misjudge
      it, but open and manifest at least to the two persons whom it concerns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I take it,&rdquo; said Dagoucin, &ldquo;but it would be better to have one of the
      two ignorant of it rather than have it known to a third. I believe that
      the love of the woman in the story was all the deeper for not being
      declared.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be that as it may,&rdquo; said Longarine, &ldquo;virtue should be esteemed, and the
      highest virtue is to subdue one&rsquo;s own heart. Considering the opportunities
      that the maiden had of forgetting conscience and honour, and the virtue
      she displayed in all these opportunities and temptations by subduing her
      heart, will, and even him whom she loved better than herself, I say that
      she might well be called a strong woman. And, since you measure virtue by
      the mortification of self, I say that the lord deserved higher praise than
      she, if we remember the greatness of his love, his opportunities, and his
      power. Yet he would not offend against that rule of true love which
      renders prince and peasant equal, but employed only such means as honour
      allows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are many,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;who would not have acted in the same way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the more is he to be esteemed,&rdquo; said Longarine, &ldquo;in having
      subdued the common craftiness of men. He who can do evil and yet does it
      not is happy indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your words,&rdquo; said Geburon, &ldquo;remind me of one who was more afraid of doing
      wrong in the eyes of men than of offending against God, her honour and
      love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I pray you tell us the story,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;for I give you my
      vote.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are some persons,&rdquo; said Geburon, &ldquo;who have no God, or, if they
      believe in one, think Him so far away that He can neither see nor know the
      wicked acts that they commit; or, if He does, imagine that He pays no heed
      to things here below, and is too careless to punish them. Of this opinion
      was a lady, whose name I will alter for the sake of her family, and whom I
      will call Jambicque.( 5) She used often to say that a woman who had only
      God to deal with was very fortunate, if for the rest she was able to
      maintain her honour among men. But you will see, ladies, that her prudence
      and her hypocrisy did not prevent her secret from being discovered, as
      will appear from her story, wherein the truth shall be set forth in full,
      except that the names of persons and places will be changed.&rdquo;
     </p>

      <i>TALE XLIII</i>.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>Jambicque, preferring the praise of the world to a good
     conscience, strove to appear before men other than site
     really was; but her friend and lover discovered her
     hypocrisy by means of a little chalk-mark, and made known to
     everybody the wickedness that she was at such pains to
     hide</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      There dwelt in a very handsome castle a high and mighty Princess, who had
      in her train a very haughty lady called Jambicque. (1) The latter had so
      deceived her mistress that the Princess did nothing save by her advice,
      deeming her the discreetest and most virtuous lady of her day.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  There are no means of positively identifying this woman.
     Brantôme, who refers at length to the above tale in his
     <i>Vies des Dames Galantes</i> (Lalanne&rsquo;s edition, pp. 236-8),
     implies that he knew her name but would not tell it. He
     says, however, that &ldquo;she was a widow and lady of honour to a
     very great Princess, and knew better how to play the prude
     than any other lady at Court.&rdquo;&mdash;M.
</pre>
    <p>
      This Jambicque used greatly to inveigh against wanton passion, and
      whenever she perceived any gentleman in love with one of her companions,
      she would chide them with much harshness, and, by making ill report of
      them to her mistress, often cause them to be rebuked; hence she was feared
      far more than she was loved by all the household. As for herself, she
      never spoke to a man except in a loud voice, and with much haughtiness,
      and was therefore reputed a deadly enemy to all love. Nevertheless, it was
      quite otherwise with her heart, for there was a gentleman in her
      mistress&rsquo;s service towards whom she entertained so strong a passion that,
      at last, she could no longer endure it. (2)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     2  Brantôme writes as follows concerning the gentleman
     referred to above: &ldquo;According to what I have heard from my
     mother, [Anne de Vivonne, wife of Francis de Bourdeille],
     who was in the Queen of Navarre&rsquo;s service and knew some of
     her secrets, and was herself one of the narrators [of the
     <i>Heptameron</i>, i.e., Ennasuite], this gentleman was my late
     uncle La Chastàigneraye, who was brusque, hasty, and rather
     fickle. The tale, however, is so disguised as to hide this,
     for my said uncle was never in the service of the great
     Princess, who was mistress of the lady [Jambicque], but in
     that of the King her brother.&rdquo; This shows the Princess to
     have been Queen Margaret herself; and Jambicque, being
     described by Brantôme as a widow and lady of honour to the
     Princess, might possibly be Blanche de Tournon ( Madame de
     Chastillon), concerning whom see vol. i. of the present
     work, p. 84 (note 7) and pp. 122-4. Her successor as lady of
     honour to Margaret was Brantôme&rsquo;s own grandmother, of whom
     he says that she was not so shrewd, artful, or ready-witted
     in love matters as her predecessor. On the other hand,
     Blanche de Tournon must have been over forty when La
     Chastàigneraye engaged in this adventure, even allowing that
     he was only a youth at the time.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      The regard which she had for honour and good name caused her to conceal
      her affection, but after she had been consumed by this passion for a full
      year, being unwilling to find relief as other lovers do in look and
      speech, she felt her heart so aflame that, in the end, she sought the
      final cure. And she resolved that it were better to satisfy her desire
      with none but God in the secret of her heart, rather than speak of it to a
      man who might some time make it known.
    </p>
    <p>
      After taking this resolve, she chanced to be one day in her mistress&rsquo;s
      apartment, when, looking out upon a terrace, she perceived walking there
      the man whom she so dearly loved. She gazed upon him until the falling
      darkness was hiding him from her sight, when she called a little page of
      hers, and pointing to the gentleman, said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you see yonder that gentleman who wears a crimson satin doublet and
      cloak of lynx fur? Go and tell him that one of his friends would speak
      with him in the garden gallery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the page was gone, she herself passed through her mistress&rsquo;s
      wardrobe and into the gallery, having first put on her low hood and
      half-mask. (3)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     3  See <i>ante</i>, vol. iii. p. 27.
</pre>
    <p>
      When the gentleman was come to where she was waiting, she immediately shut
      the two doors by which they might have been surprised, and then, without
      taking off her mask, embraced him very closely, and in the softest whisper
      imaginable said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a long time, sweetheart, the love I bear you has made me desire time
      and place for speaking with you, but fearfulness for my honour was for a
      while so strong as to oblige me, in my own despite, to conceal my passion.
      Albeit, in the end, the strength of love has vanquished fear, and, in the
      knowledge that I have of your honour, I protest to you that if you will
      promise to love me without ever speaking of the matter to any one, or
      asking of me who I am, I will be your true and faithful sweetheart, and
      will never love any man but you. But I would rather die than that you
      should know who I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman promised her what she asked, which made her very ready to do
      as much for him, namely, to refuse him nothing he might desire to have. It
      was between five and six o&rsquo;clock in winter-time, so that he could see
      nothing of the lady, but by the touch of her dress he perceived that it
      was of velvet, which at that time was not worn every day except by ladies
      of high and mighty lineage. And so far as his hand could let him judge of
      what was beneath, there was nothing there that was not excellent, trim,
      and plump. Accordingly, he was at pains to entertain her as well as he was
      able. She on her part did no less, and the gentleman readily perceived
      that she was a married woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      She desired afterwards to return immediately to the place whence she had
      come, but the gentleman said to her&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I esteem greatly the undeserved favour that you have shown me, but I
      shall esteem still more that which you may bestow at my request. So well
      pleased am I by this your kindness, that I would fain learn whether I may
      not look for more of the same sort, and, also, in what manner you would
      have me act; for, knowing you not, I shall be powerless to woo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have no concern,&rdquo; said the lady, &ldquo;about that. You may rest assured that
      every evening, before my mistress sups, I shall not fail to send for you,
      and do you be in readiness on the terrace where you were just now. I shall
      merely send you word to remember what you have promised, and in this way
      you will know that I am waiting for you here in the gallery. But if you
      hear talk of going to table, you may withdraw for that day or else come
      into our mistress&rsquo;s apartment. Above all things, I pray you will never
      seek to know me, if you would not forthwith bring our friendship to an
      end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So the lady and the gentleman went their several ways. And although their
      love affair lasted for a great while, he could never learn who she was. He
      pondered much upon the matter, wondering within himself who she might be.
      He could not imagine that any woman in the world would fain be unseen and
      unloved; and, having heard some foolish preacher say that no one who had
      looked upon the face of the devil could ever love him, he suspected that
      his mistress might be some evil spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this perplexity he resolved to try and find out who it was that
      entertained him so well, and when next she sent for him he brought some
      chalk, and, while embracing her, marked the back of her shoulder without
      her knowledge. Then, as soon as she was gone, the gentleman went with all
      speed to his mistress&rsquo;s apartment, and stood beside the door in order to
      look from behind at the shoulders of those ladies that might go in.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw Jambicque enter among the rest, but with so haughty a bearing that
      he feared to look at her as keenly as at the others, and felt quite sure
      that it could not have been she. Nevertheless, when her back was turned,
      he perceived the chalk mark, whereat he was so greatly astonished that he
      could hardly believe his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, after considering both her figure, which was just such a one as
      his hands had known, and her features, which he recognised in the same
      way, he perceived that it was indeed none other than herself. And he was
      well pleased to think that a woman who had never been reputed to have a
      lover, and who had refused so many worthy gentlemen, should have chosen
      himself alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Love, which is ever changeful of mood, could not suffer him to live
      long in such repose, but, filling him with self-conceit and hope, led him
      to make known his love, in the expectation that she would then hold him
      still more dear.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, when the Princess was in the garden, the lady Jambicque went to
      walk in a pathway by herself. The gentleman, seeing that she was alone,
      went up to converse with her, and, as though he had never elsewhere met
      her, spoke as follows&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mistress, I have long borne towards you in my heart an affection which,
      through dread of displeasing you, I have never ventured to reveal. But now
      my pain has come to be such that I can no longer endure it and live, for I
      think that no man could ever have loved you as I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Lady Jambicque would not allow him to finish his discourse, but said
      to him in great wrath&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever hear or see that I had sweetheart or lover? I trow not, and
      am indeed astonished to find you bold enough to address such words to a
      virtuous woman like me. You have lived in the same house long enough to
      know that I shall never love other than my husband; beware, then, of
      speaking further after this fashion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this hypocrisy the gentleman could not refrain from laughing and saying
      to her&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not always so stern, madam, as you are now. What boots it to use
      such concealment towards me? Is it not better to have a perfect than an
      imperfect love?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no love for you,&rdquo; replied Jambicque, &ldquo;whether perfect or
      imperfect, except such as I bear to the rest of my mistress&rsquo;s servants.
      But if you speak further to me as you have spoken now, I shall perhaps
      have such hatred for you as may be to your hurt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      However, the gentleman persisted in his discourse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is the kindness that you show me when I cannot see you?
      Why do you withhold it from me now when the light suffers me to behold
      both your beauty and your excellent and perfect grace?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jambicque, making a great sign of the cross, replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Either you have lost your understanding or you are the greatest liar
      alive. Never in my life have I to my knowledge shown you more kindness or
      less than I do at this moment, and I pray you therefore tell me what it is
      you mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the unhappy gentleman, thinking to better his fortune with her, told
      her of the place where he had met her, and of the chalk-mark which he had
      made in order to recognise her, on hearing which she was so beside herself
      with anger as to tell him that he was the wickedest of men, and that she
      would bring him to repent of the foul falsehood that he had invented
      against her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman, knowing how well she stood with her mistress, sought to
      soothe her, but he found it impossible to do so; for, leaving him where he
      stood, she furiously betook herself to her mistress, who, loving Jambicque
      as she did herself, left all the company to come and speak with her, and,
      on finding her in such great wrath, inquired of her what the matter was.
      Thereupon Jambicque, who had no wish to hide it, related all the
      gentleman&rsquo;s discourse, and this she did so much to the unhappy man&rsquo;s
      disadvantage, that on the very same evening his mistress commanded him to
      withdraw forthwith to his own home without speaking with anyone and to
      stay there until he should be sent for. And this he did right speedily,
      for fear of worse. (4)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     4  It has been mentioned in note 2 that the gentleman in
     question was Brantôme&rsquo;s uncle La Chastaigneraye. Born,
     according to most accounts, in 1520, Francis de Vivonne,
     Lord of La Chastaigneraye, was a godson of Francis I., and
     early displayed marked skill and prowess in all bodily
     exercises and feats of arms. He was, however, of a very
     quarrelsome disposition, and had several duels. A dispute
     arising between him and Guy de Chabot, Lord of Jarnac, they
     solicited permission to fight, but Francis I. would not
     accord it, and it was only after the accession of Henry II.
     that the encounter took place. The spot fixed upon was the
     park of St. Germain-en-Laye, and the King and the whole
     Court were present (July 10, 1547)&mdash;In the result, La
     Chastaigneraye was literally ham-strung by a back-thrust
     known to this day as the <i>coup de Jarnac</i>. The victor
     thereupon begged the King to accept his adversary&rsquo;s life and
     person, and Henry, after telling Jamac that &ldquo;he had fought
     like Cæsar and spoken like Cicero,&rdquo; caused La Chastaigneraye
     to be carried to his tent that his wound might be dressed.
     Deeply humiliated by his defeat, however, the vanquished
     combatant tore off his bandages and bled to death.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      So long as Jambicque dwelt with her mistress, the gentleman returned not
      to the Princess&rsquo;s house, nor did he ever have tidings of her who had vowed
      to him that he should lose her as soon as he might seek her out. (5)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     5  After referring to this tale Brantôme adds that he had
     heard tell of another Court lady who was minded to imitate
     Jambicque, but who, &ldquo;every time she returned from her
     assignation, went straight to her room, and let one of her
     serving maids examine her on all sides to see if she were
     marked. By this means she guarded herself against being
     surprised and recognised, and indeed was never marked until
     at her ninth assignation, when the mark was at once
     discovered by her women. And thereupon, for fear of scandal
     and opprobrium, she broke off her intrigue and never more
     returned to the appointed spot. Some one said &lsquo;twould have
     been better if she had let her lover mark her as often as he
     liked, and each time have had his marks effaced, for in this
     wise she would have reaped a double pleasure&mdash;contentment in
     love and satisfaction at duping her lover, who, like he who
     seeks the Philosopher&rsquo;s Stone, would have toiled hard to
     discover and identify her, without ever succeeding in doing
     so.&rdquo;&mdash;(Lalanne&rsquo;s <i>OEuvres de Brantôme</i>, pp. 236-8).&mdash;M.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By this tale, ladies, you may see how one who preferred the world&rsquo;s
      esteem to a good conscience lost both the one and the other. For now may
      the eyes of all men read what she strove to hide from those of her lover,
      and so, whilst fleeing the derision of one, she has incurred the derision
      of all. Nor can she be held excused on the score of simplicity and artless
      love, for which all men should have pity, but she must be condemned twice
      over for having concealed her wickedness with the twofold cloak of honour
      and glory, and for making herself appear before God and man other than she
      really was. He, however, who gives not His glory to another, took this
      cloak from off her and so brought her to double shame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her wickedness,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;was without excuse. None can defend her
      when God, Honour, and even Love are her accusers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;Pleasure and Folly may; they are the true chief
      advocates of the ladies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we had no other advocates,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;than those you name, our
      cause would indeed be ill supported; but those who are vanquished by
      pleasure ought no longer to be called women but rather men, whose
      reputation is merely exalted by frenzy and lust. When a man takes
      vengeance upon his enemy and slays him for giving him the lie, he is
      deemed all the more honourable a gentleman for it; and so, too, when he
      loves a dozen women besides his own wife. But the reputation of women has
      a different foundation, that, namely, of gentleness, patience and
      chastity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak of the discreet,&rdquo; said Hircan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; returned Parlamente, &ldquo;because I will know none others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If none were wanton,&rdquo; said Nomerfide, &ldquo;those who would fain be believed
      by all the world must often have lied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, Nomerfide,&rdquo; said Geburon, &ldquo;receive my vote, and forget that you are
      a woman, in order that we may learn what some men that are accounted
      truthful say of the follies of your sex.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since virtue compels me to it, and you have made it my turn, I will tell
      you what I know. I have not heard any lady or gentleman present speak
      otherwise than to the disadvantage of the Grey Friars, and out of pity I
      have resolved to speak well of them in the story that I am now about to
      relate.&rdquo;

      <i>TALE XLIV.(A)</i>.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>In reward for not having concealed the truth, the Lord of
     Sedan doubled the alms of a Grey Friar, who thus received
     two pigs instead of one</i>. (1)
</pre>
    <p>
      To the castle of Sedan once came a Grey Friar to ask my Lady of Sedan, who
      was of the house of Crouy, (2) for a pig, which she was wont to give to
      his Order every year as alms.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  This tale, though it figures in all the MSS., does not
     appear in Gruget&rsquo;s edition of the <i>Heptameron</i>, but is there
     replaced by the one that follows, XLIV. (B).&mdash;Ed.

     2  This Lady of Sedan is Catherine de Croï, daughter of
     Philip VI. de Croï, Count of Chimay. In 1491 she married
     Robert II. do la Marck, Duke of Bouillon, Lord of Sedan,
     Fleuranges, &amp;c., who was long the companion in arms of
     Bayard and La Trémoïlle. Robert II. lost the duchy of
     Bouillon through the conquests of Charles V., and one of the
     clauses of the treaty of Cambrai (the &ldquo;Ladies&rsquo; Peace&rdquo;) was
     that Francis I. would in no wise assist him to regain it.
     His eldest son by Catherine de Croï was the celebrated
     Marshal de Fleuranges, &ldquo;the young adventurer,&rdquo; who left such
     curious memoirs behind him. Robert II. died in 1535, his son
     surviving him a couple of years.&mdash;Anselme&rsquo;s <i>Histoire
     Généalogique</i>, vol. vii. p. 167.&mdash;L. and B. J.
</pre>
    <p>
      My Lord of Sedan, who was a prudent man and a merry talker, had the good
      father to eat at his table, and in order to put him on his mettle said to
      him, among other things&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good father, you do well to make your collection while you are yet
      unknown. I greatly fear that, if once your hypocrisy be found out, you
      will no longer receive the bread of poor children, earned by the sweat of
      their fathers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Grey Friar was not abashed by these words, but replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our Order, my lord, is so securely founded that it will endure as long as
      the world exists. Our foundation, indeed, cannot fail so long as there are
      men and women on the earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My Lord of Sedan, being desirous of knowing on what foundation the
      existence of the Grey Friars was thus based, urgently begged the father to
      tell him.
    </p>
    <p>
      After making many excuses, the Friar at last replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since you are pleased to command me to tell you, you shall hear. Know,
      then, my lord, that our foundation is the folly of women, and that so long
      as there be a wanton or foolish woman in the world we shall not die of
      hunger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My Lady of Sedan, who was very passionate, was in such wrath on hearing
      these words, that, had her husband not been present, she would have dealt
      harshly with the Grey Friar; and indeed she swore roundly that he should
      not have the pig that she had promised him; but the Lord of Sedan, finding
      that he had not concealed the truth, swore that he should have two, and
      caused them to be sent to his monastery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, ladies, how the Grey Friar, being sure that the favour of the
      ladies could not fail him, contrived, by concealing nothing of the truth,
      to win the favour and alms of men. Had he been a flatterer and dissembler,
      he would have been more pleasing to the ladies, but not so profitable to
      himself and his brethren.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tale was not concluded without making the whole company laugh, and
      especially such among them as knew the Lord and Lady of Sedan. And Hircan
      said&mdash;&ldquo;The Grey Friars, then, should never preach with intent to make
      women wise, since their folly is of so much service to the Order.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They do not preach to them,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;with intent to make them
      wise, but only to make them think themselves so. Women who are altogether
      worldly and foolish do not give them much alms; nevertheless, those who
      think themselves the wisest because they go often to monasteries, and
      carry paternosters marked with a death&rsquo;s head, and wear caps lower than
      others, must also be accounted foolish, for they rest their salvation on
      their confidence in the holiness of wicked men, whom they are led by a
      trifling semblance to regard as demigods.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But who could help believing them,&rdquo; said Enna-suite, &ldquo;since they have
      been ordained by our prelates to preach the Gospel to us and rebuke our
      sins?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those who have experienced their hypocrisy,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;and who
      know the difference between the doctrine of God and that of the devil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jesus!&rdquo; said Ennasuite. &ldquo;Can you think that these men would dare to
      preach false doctrine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think?&rdquo; replied Parlamente. &ldquo;Nay, I am sure that they believe anything
      but the Gospel. I speak only of the bad among them; for I know many worthy
      men who preach the Scriptures in all purity and simplicity, and live
      without reproach, ambition, or covetousness, and in such chastity as is
      unfeigned and free. However, the streets are not paved with such as these,
      but are rather distinguished by their opposites; and the good tree is
      known by its fruit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In very sooth,&rdquo; said Ennasuite, &ldquo;I thought we were bound on pain of
      mortal sin to believe all they tell us from the pulpit as truth, that is,
      when they speak of what is in the Holy Scriptures, or cite the expositions
      of holy doctrines divinely inspired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my part,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;I cannot but see that there are men of
      very corrupt faith among them. I know that one of them, a Doctor of
      Theology and a Principal in their Order, (3) sought to persuade many of
      the brethren that the Gospel was no more worthy of belief than Cæsar&rsquo;s
      Commentaries or any other histories written by learned men of authority;
      and from the hour I heard that I would believe no preacher&rsquo;s word unless I
      found it in harmony with the Word of God, which is the true touchstone for
      distinguishing between truth and falsehood.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     3  In MS. No. 1520 this passage runs, &ldquo;a Doctor of Theology
     named Colimant, a great preacher and a Principal in their
     Order.&rdquo; However, none of the numerous works on the history
     of the Franciscans makes any mention of a divine called
     Colimant.&mdash;B. J.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be assured,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;that those who read it constantly and with
      humility will never be led into error by deceits or human inventions; for
      whosoever has a mind filled with truth cannot believe a lie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet it seems to me,&rdquo; said Simontault, &ldquo;that a simple person is more
      readily deceived than another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Longarine, &ldquo;if you deem foolishness to be the same thing as
      simplicity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I affirm,&rdquo; replied Simontault, &ldquo;that a good, gentle and simple woman is
      more readily deceived than one who is wily and wicked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Nomerfide, &ldquo;that you must know of one overflowing with
      such goodness, and so I give you my vote that you may tell us of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since you have guessed so well,&rdquo; said Simontault, &ldquo;I will indeed tell you
      of her, but you must promise not to weep. Those who declare, ladies, that
      your craftiness surpasses that of men would find it hard to bring forward
      such an instance as I am now about to relate, wherein I propose to show
      you not only the exceeding craftiness of a husband, but also the
      simplicity and goodness of his wife.&rdquo;

      <i>TALE XLIV. (B)</i>.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>Concerning the subtlety of two lovers in the enjoyment of
     their love, and the happy issue of the latter</i>. (1)

     1  This is the tale given by Gruget in his edition of the
     <i>Heptameron</i>, in lieu of the preceding one.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      In the city of Paris there lived two citizens of middling condition, of
      whom one had a profession, while the other was a silk mercer. These two
      were very old friends and constant companions, and so it happened that the
      son of the former, a young man, very presentable in good company, and
      called James, used often by his father&rsquo;s favour to visit the mercer&rsquo;s
      house. This, however, he did for the sake of the mercer&rsquo;s beautiful
      daughter named Frances, whom he loved; and so well did James contrive
      matters with her, that he came to know her to be no less loving than
      loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst matters were in this state, however, a camp was formed in Provence
      in view of withstanding the descent of Charles of Austria, (2) and James,
      being called upon the list, was obliged to betake himself to the army. At
      the very beginning of the campaign his father passed from life into death,
      the tidings whereof brought him double sorrow, on the one part for the
      loss of his father, and on the other for the difficulty he should have on
      his return in seeing his sweetheart as often as he had hoped.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     2  Charles V. entered Provence by way of Piedmont in the
     summer of 1536, and invested Marseilles. A scarcity of
     supplies and much sickness among his troops compelled him,
     however, to raise the siege.&mdash;M.
</pre>
    <p>
      As time went on, the first of these griefs was forgotten and the other
      increased. Since death is a natural thing, and for the most part befalls
      the father before the children, the sadness it causes gradually
      disappears; but love, instead of bringing us death, brings us life through
      the procreation of children, in whom we have immortality, and this it is
      which chiefly causes our desires to increase.
    </p>
    <p>
      James, therefore, when he had returned to Paris, thought or cared for
      nothing save how he might renew his frequent visits to the mercer&rsquo;s house,
      and so, under cloak of pure friendship for him, traffic in his dearest
      wares. On the other hand, during his absence, Frances had been urgently
      sought by others, both because of her beauty and of her wit, and also
      because she was long since come to marriageable years; but whether it was
      that her father was avaricious, or that, since she was his only daughter,
      he was over anxious to establish her well, he failed to perform his duty
      in the matter. This, however, tended but little to her honour, for in
      these days people speak ill of one long before they have any reason to do
      so, and particularly in aught that concerns the chastity of a beautiful
      woman or maid. Her father did not shut his ears or eyes to the general
      gossip, nor seek resemblance with many others who, instead of rebuking
      wrongdoing, seem rather to incite their wives and children to it, for he
      kept her with such strictness that even those who sought her with offers
      of marriage could see her but seldom, and then only in presence of her
      mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      It were needless to ask whether James found all this hard of endurance. He
      could not conceive that such rigour should be without weighty reason, and
      therefore wavered greatly between love and jealousy. However, he resolved
      at all risks to learn the cause, but wished first of all to know whether
      her affection was the same as before; he therefore set about this, and
      coming one morning to church, he placed himself near her to hear mass, and
      soon perceived by her countenance that she was no less glad to see him
      than he was to see her. Accordingly, knowing that the mother was less
      stern than the father, he was sometimes, when he met them on their way to
      church, bold enough to accost them as though by chance, and with a
      familiar and ordinary greeting; all, however, being done expressly so that
      he might the better work his ends.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be brief, when the year of mourning for his father was drawing to an
      end, he resolved, on laying aside his weeds, to cut a good figure and do
      credit to his forefathers; and of this he spoke to his mother, who
      approved his design; for having but two children, himself and a daughter
      already well and honourably mated, she greatly desired to see him suitably
      married. And, indeed, like the worthy lady that she was, she still further
      incited his heart in the direction of virtue by countless instances of
      other young men of his own age who were making their way unaided, or at
      least were showing themselves worthy of those from whom they sprang.
    </p>
    <p>
      It now only remained to determine where they should equip themselves, and
      the mother said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am of opinion, James, that we should go to our friend Master Peter,&rdquo;&mdash;that
      is, to the father of Frances&mdash;&ldquo;for, knowing us, he will not cheat
      us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His mother was indeed tickling him where he itched; however, he held firm
      and replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will go where we may find the cheapest and the best. Still,&rdquo; he added,
      &ldquo;for the sake of his friendship with my departed father, I am willing that
      we should visit him first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matters being thus contrived, the mother and son went one morning to see
      Master Peter, who made them welcome; for traders, as you know, are never
      backward in this respect. They caused great quantities of all kinds of
      silk to be displayed before them, and chose what they required; but they
      could not agree upon the price, for James haggled on purpose, because his
      sweetheart&rsquo;s mother did not come in. So at last they went away without
      buying anything, in order to see what could be done elsewhere. But James
      could find nothing so handsome as in his sweetheart&rsquo;s house, and thither
      after a while they returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mercer&rsquo;s wife was now there and gave them the best reception
      imaginable, and after such bargaining as is common in shops of the kind,
      during which Peter&rsquo;s wife proved even harder than her husband, James said
      to her&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In sooth, madam, you are very hard to deal with. I can see how it is; we
      have lost my father, and our friends recognise us no longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he pretended to weep and wipe his eyes at thought of his
      departed father; but &lsquo;twas done in order to further his design.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good widow, his mother, took the matter in perfect faith, and on her
      part said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are as little visited since his death as if we had never been known.
      Such is the regard in which poor widows are held!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upon this the two women exchanged fresh declarations of affection, and
      promised to see each other oftener than ever. While they were thus
      discoursing, there came in other traders, whom the master himself led into
      the back shop. Then the young man perceived his opportunity, and said to
      his mother&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have often on feast days seen this good lady going to visit the holy
      places in our neighbourhood, and especially the convents. Now if, when
      passing, she would sometimes condescend to take wine with us, she would do
      us at once pleasure and honour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mercer&rsquo;s wife, who suspected no harm, replied that for more than a
      fortnight past she had intended to go thither, that, if it were fair, she
      would probably do so on the following Sunday, and that she would then
      certainly visit the lady at her house. This affair being concluded, the
      bargain for the silk quickly followed, since, for the sake of a little
      money, &lsquo;twould have been foolish to let slip so excellent an opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      When matters had been thus contrived, and the merchandise taken away,
      James, knowing that he could not alone achieve so difficult an enterprise,
      was constrained to make it known to a faithful friend named Oliver, and
      they took such good counsel together that nothing now remained but to put
      their plan into execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, when Sunday was come, the mercer&rsquo;s wife and her daughter, on
      returning from worship, failed not to visit the widow, whom they found
      talking with a neighbour in a gallery that looked upon the garden, while
      her daughter was walking in the pathways with James and Oliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      When James saw his sweetheart, he so controlled himself that his
      countenance showed no change, and in this sort went forward to receive the
      mother and her daughter. Then, as the old commonly seek the old, the three
      ladies sat down together on a bench with their backs to the garden,
      whither the lovers gradually made their way, and at last reached the place
      where were the other two. Thus meeting, they exchanged some courtesies and
      then began to walk about once more, whereupon the young man related his
      pitiful case to Frances, and this so well that, while unwilling to grant,
      she yet durst not refuse what he sought; and he could indeed see that she
      was in a sore strait. It must, however, be understood that, while thus
      discoursing, they often, to take away all ground for suspicion, passed and
      repassed in front of the shelter-place where the worthy dames were seated&mdash;talking
      the while on commonplace and ordinary matters, and at times disporting
      themselves through the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, in the space of half-an-hour, when the good women had become well
      accustomed to this behaviour, James made a sign to Oliver, who played his
      part with the girl that was with him so cleverly, that she did not
      perceive the two lovers going into a close rilled with cherry trees, and
      well shut in by tall rose trees and gooseberry bushes. (3) They made show
      of going thither in order to gather some almonds which were in a corner of
      the close, but their purpose was to gather plums.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     3  Large gardens and enclosures were then plentiful in the
     heart of Paris. Forty years ago, when the Boulevard
     Sebastopol was laid out, it was found that many of the
     houses in the ancient Rues St. Martin and St. Denis had, in
     their rear, gardens of considerable extent containing
     century-old trees, the existence of which had never been
     suspected by the passers-by in those then cramped and dingy
     thoroughfares.&mdash;M.
</pre>
    <p>
      Accordingly, James, instead of giving his sweetheart a green gown, gave
      her a red one, and its colour even came into her face through finding
      herself surprised sooner than she had expected. And these plums of theirs
      being ripe, they plucked them with such expedition that Oliver himself had
      not believed it possible, but that he perceived the girl to droop her gaze
      and look ashamed. This taught him the truth, for she had before walked
      with head erect, with no fear lest the vein in her eye, which ought to be
      red, should take an azure hue. However, when James perceived her
      perturbation, he recalled her to herself by fitting remonstrances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, while making the next two or three turns about the garden,
      she would not refrain from tears and sighs, or from saying again and again&mdash;&ldquo;Alas!
      was it for this you loved me? If only I could have imagined it! Heavens!
      what shall I do? I am ruined for life. What will you now think of me? I
      feel sure you will respect me no longer, if, at least, you are one of
      those that love but for their own pleasure. Alas, why did I not die before
      falling into such an error?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shed many tears while uttering these words, but James comforted her
      with many promises and oaths, and so, before they had gone thrice again
      round the garden, or James had signalled to his comrade, they once more
      entered the close, but by another path. And there, in spite of all, she
      could not but receive more delight from the second green gown than from
      the first; from which moment her satisfaction was such that they took
      counsel together how they might see each other with more frequency and
      convenience until her father should see fit to consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this matter they were greatly assisted by a young woman, who was
      neighbour to Master Peter; she had some kinship with James, and was a good
      friend to Frances. And in this way, from what I can understand, they
      continued without scandal until the celebration of the marriage, when
      Frances, being an only child, proved to be very rich for a trader&rsquo;s
      daughter. James had, however, to wait for the greater part of his fortune
      until the death of his father-in-law, for the latter was so grasping a man
      that he seemed to think one hand capable of robbing him of that which he
      held in the other. (4)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     4  This reminds one of Moliere&rsquo;s Harpagon, when he requires
     La Flèche to show him his hands. See <i>L&rsquo;Avare</i>, act i. sc.
     iii.&mdash;M.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In this story, ladies, you see a love affair well begun, well carried on,
      and better ended. For although it is a common thing among you men to scorn
      a girl or woman as soon as she has freely given what you chiefly seek in
      her, yet this young man was animated by sound and sincere love; and
      finding in his sweetheart what every husband desires in the girl he weds,
      and knowing, moreover, that she was of good birth, and discreet in all
      respects, save for the error into which he himself had led her, he would
      not act the adulterer or be the cause of an unhappy marriage elsewhere.
      And for this I hold him worthy of high praise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;they were both to blame, ay, and the third party
      also who assisted or at least concurred in a rape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you call that a rape,&rdquo; said Saffredent, &ldquo;in which both parties are
      agreed? Is there any marriage better than one thus resulting from secret
      love? The proverb says that marriages are made in heaven, but this does
      not hold of forced marriages, nor of such as are made for money or are
      deemed to be completely sanctioned as soon as the parents have given their
      consent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may say what you will,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;but we must recognise that
      obedience is due to parents, or, in default of them, to other kinsfolk.
      Otherwise, if all were permitted to marry at will, how many horned
      marriages should we not find? Is it to be presumed that a young man and a
      girl of twelve or fifteen years can know what is good for them? If we
      examined into the happiness of marriages on the whole, we should find that
      at least as many love-matches have turned out ill as those that were made
      under compulsion. Young people, who do not know what is good for them,
      attach themselves heedlessly to the first that comes; then by degrees they
      find out their error and fall into others that are still greater. On the
      other hand, most of those who act under compulsion proceed by the advice
      of people who have seen more and have more judgment than the persons
      concerned, and so when these come to feel the good that was before unknown
      to them, they rejoice in it and embrace it with far more eagerness and
      affection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, madam,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;but you have forgotten that the girl was of
      full age and marriageable, and that she was aware of her father&rsquo;s
      injustice in letting her virginity grow musty rather than rub the rust off
      his crown pieces. And do you not know that nature is a jade? She loved and
      was loved; she found her happiness close to her hand, and she may have
      remembered the proverb, &lsquo;She that will not when she may, when she will she
      shall have nay.&rsquo; All these things, added to her wooer&rsquo;s despatch, gave her
      no time to resist. Further, you have heard that immediately afterwards her
      face showed that some noteworthy change had been wrought in her. She was
      perhaps annoyed at the shortness of the time afforded her to decide
      whether the thing were good or bad, for no great pressing was needed to
      make her try a second time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, for my part,&rdquo; said Longarine, &ldquo;I can find no excuse for such
      conduct, except that I approve the good faith shown by the youth who,
      comporting himself like an honest man, would not forsake her, but took her
      such as he had made her. In this respect, considering the corruption and
      depravity of the youth of the present day, I deem him worthy of high
      praise. I would not for all that seek to excuse his first fault, which, in
      fact, amounted to rape in respect to the daughter, and subornation with
      regard to the mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Dagoucin, &ldquo;there was neither rape nor subornation.
      Everything was done by mere consent, both on the part of the mothers, who
      did not prevent it (though, indeed, they were deceived), and on that of
      the daughter, who was pleased by it, and so never complained.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was all the result,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;of the great kindliness and
      simplicity of the mercer&rsquo;s wife, who unwittingly led the maiden to the
      slaughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, to the wedding,&rdquo; said Simontault, &ldquo;where such simplicity was no less
      profitable to the girl than it once was hurtful to one who suffered
      herself to be readily duped by her husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since you know such a story,&rdquo; said Nomerfide, &ldquo;I give you my vote that
      you may tell it to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will indeed do so,&rdquo; said Simontault, &ldquo;but you must promise not to weep.
      Those who declare, ladies, that your craftiness surpasses that of men,
      would find it hard to bring forward such an instance as I will now relate,
      wherein I propose to show you not only the great craftiness of a husband,
      but the exceeding simplicity and goodness of his wife.&rdquo;

      <i>TALE XLV</i>.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>At his wife&rsquo;s request, an upholsterer of Tours gave the
     Innocents to his serving-maid, with whom he was in love; but
     he did so after such a fashion as to let her have what
     belonged by right only to his wife, who, for her part, was
     such a simpleton that she could never believe her husband
     had so wronged her, albeit she had abundant warning thereof
     from a neighbour</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      In the city of Tours dwelt a man of shrewd and sound understanding, who
      was upholsterer to the late Duke of Orleans, (1) son of King Francis the
      First; and although this upholsterer had, through sickness, become deaf,
      he had nevertheless lost nothing of his wit, which, in regard both to his
      trade and to other matters, was as shrewd as any man&rsquo;s. And how he was
      able to avail himself of it you shall hear.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  Charles of France, Duke of Orleans, Bourbonnais,
     Angoumois and Châtelherault, Count of Clermont, La Marche,
     and Civray, Governor and Lieutenant-General of Champagne and
     Brie. He has been referred to in the Memoir of Queen
     Margaret, <i>ante</i>, vol. i. pp. xxxvi., xlvii.-viii. Born at
     St. Germain in January 1521, the Duke of Orleans took part
     in several military expeditions, and gave proof of much
     ability as a commander. He died, according to some accounts,
     of a pleurisy, and, according to others, of the plague, in
     1545. The above story was evidently written subsequent to
     that date, as Queen Margaret refers to him as &ldquo;the late Duke
     of Orleans.&rdquo;&mdash;L.
</pre>
    <p>
      He had married a virtuous and honourable woman, with whom he lived in
      great peace and quietness. He was very fearful of displeasing her, whilst
      she, on her part, sought in all things to obey him. But, for all the
      affection that he bore her, he was so charitably inclined that he would
      often give to his female neighbours that which by right belonged to his
      wife, though this he did as secretly as he was able.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was in their house a very plump serving-maid with whom the
      upholsterer fell in love. Nevertheless, dreading lest his wife should know
      this, he often made show of scolding and rebuking her, saying that she was
      the laziest wench he had ever known, though this was no wonder, seeing
      that her mistress never beat her. And thus it came to pass that one day,
      while they were speaking about giving the Innocents, (2) the upholsterer
      said to his wife&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It were a charity to give them to that lazy wench of yours, but it should
      not be with your hand, for it is too feeble, and in like way your heart is
      too pitiful for such a task. If, however, I were to make use of mine, she
      would serve us better than she now does.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     2  Prior to the Reformation it was the custom, not only in
     France but throughout Europe, to whip children on the
     morning of Innocents&rsquo; Day (December 28), in order, says
     Gregory in his treatise on the <i>Boy Bishop</i>, &ldquo;that the
     memory of Herod&rsquo;s murder of the Innocents might stick the
     closer.&rdquo; This custom (concerning which see Haspinian, <i>De
     Orig. Festor, Christianor</i>. fol. 160) subsequently
     degenerated into a jocular usage, so far as the children
     were concerned, and town-gallants and country-swains
     commonly sought to surprise young women in bed, and make
     them play the part of the Innocents, more frequently than
     otherwise to the loss of their virtue. A story is told of a
     French nobleman who in taking leave of some ladies to join a
     hunting party, heard one of them whisper, &ldquo;We shall sleep at
     our ease, and pass the Innocents without receiving them.&rdquo;
      This put the nobleman, a certain Seigneur du Rivau, on his
     mettle. &ldquo;He kept his appointment,&rdquo; we are told, &ldquo;galloped
     back twenty leagues at night, arrived at the lady&rsquo;s house at
     dawn on Innocents&rsquo; Day, surprised her in bed, and used the
     privilege of the season.&rdquo; (Bonn&rsquo;s <i>Heptameron</i>, p. 301).
     Verses illustrative of the custom will be found in the works
     of Clement Marot, Jannet&rsquo;s edition, 1868, vol iii. p. 7, and
     in those of Cholières, Jouaust&rsquo;s edition, 1879, vol. i. p.
     224-6.&mdash;L. and Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      The poor woman, suspecting no harm, begged him to do execution upon the
      girl, confessing that she herself had neither strength nor heart for
      beating her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The husband willingly accepted this commission, and, playing the part of a
      stern executioner, had purchase made of the finest rods that could be
      found. To show, moreover, how anxious he was not to spare the girl, he
      caused these rods to be steeped in pickle, so that his poor wife felt far
      more pity for her maid than suspicion of her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      Innocents&rsquo; Day being come, the upholsterer rose early in the morning, and,
      going up to the room where the maid lay all alone, he gave her the
      Innocents in a different fashion to that which he had talked of with his
      wife. The maid wept full sore, but it was of no avail. Nevertheless,
      fearing lest his wife should come upon them, he fell to beating the
      bed-post with the rods which he had with him in such wise that he barked
      and broke them; and in this condition he brought them back to his wife,
      saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Methinks, sweetheart, your maid will remember the Innocents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the upholsterer was gone out of the house, the poor servant threw
      herself upon her knees before her mistress, telling her that her husband
      had done her the greatest wrong that was ever done to a serving-maid. The
      mistress, however, thinking that this merely had reference to the flogging
      which she believed to have been given, would not suffer the girl to
      finish, but said to her&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My husband did well, and only what I have for more than a month been
      urging him to do. If you were hurt I am very glad to hear it. You may lay
      it all at my door, and, what is more, he did not even do as much as he
      ought to have done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The serving-maid, finding that her mistress approved of the matter,
      thought that it could not be so great a sin as she had imagined, the more
      so as it had been brought to pass by a woman whose virtue was held in such
      high repute. Accordingly she never afterwards ventured to speak of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her master, however, seeing that his wife was as content to be deceived as
      he was to deceive her, resolved that he would frequently give her this
      contentment, and so practised on the serving-maid, that she wept no more
      at receiving the Innocents.
    </p>
    <p>
      He continued this manner of life for a great while, without his wife being
      any the wiser, until there came a time of heavy snow, when, having already
      given the girl the Innocents on the grass in his garden, he was minded to
      do the same in the snow. Accordingly, one morning before any one in the
      house was awake, he took the girl clad in nothing but her shift to make
      the crucifix in the snow, and while they were pelting each other in sport,
      they did not forget the game of the Innocents.
    </p>
    <p>
      This sport, however, was observed by one of their female neighbours who
      had gone to her window, which overlooked the garden, to see what manner of
      weather it was, and so wrathful was she at the evil sight, that she
      resolved to tell her good gossip of it, to the end that she might no
      longer suffer herself to be deceived by a wicked husband or served by a
      wanton jade.
    </p>
    <p>
      After playing these fine pranks, the upholsterer looked about him to see
      whether any one could perceive him, and to his exceeding annoyance
      observed his neighbour at her window. But just as he was able to give any
      colour to his tapestry, so he bethought him to give such a colour to what
      he had done, that his neighbour would be no less deceived than his wife.
      Accordingly, as soon as he had gone back to bed again, he made his wife
      rise in nothing but her shift, and taking her into the garden as he had
      taken his serving-maid, he played with her for a long time in the snow
      even as he had played with the other. And then he gave her the Innocents
      in the same way as he had given them to the maid, and afterwards they
      returned to bed together.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the good woman went to mass, her neighbour and excellent friend
      failed not to be there, and, while unwilling to say anything further,
      zealously begged of her to dismiss her serving-maid, who was, she said, a
      very wicked and dangerous wench. This, however, the other would not do
      without knowing why she thought so ill of the girl, and at last her
      neighbour related how she had seen the wench that morning in the garden
      with her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this the good woman fell to laughing heartily, and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! gossip dear, &lsquo;twas myself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, gossip? Why she wore naught but her shift, and it was only five
      o&rsquo;clock in the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In faith, gossip,&rdquo; replied the good woman, &ldquo;&lsquo;twas myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They pelted each other with snow,&rdquo; the other went on, &ldquo;on the breasts and
      elsewhere, as familiarly as could be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! gossip, eh!&rdquo; the good woman replied, &ldquo;&lsquo;twas myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, gossip,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;I saw them afterwards doing something in
      the snow that to my mind is neither seemly nor right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gossip,&rdquo; returned the good woman, &ldquo;I have told you, and I tell you again,
      that it was myself and none other who did all that you say, for my good
      husband and I play thus familiarly together. And, I pray you, be not
      scandalised at this, for you know that we are bound to please our
      husbands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So the worthy gossip went away, more wishful to possess such a husband for
      herself than she had been to talk about the husband of her friend; and
      when the upholsterer came home again his wife told him the whole story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now look you, sweetheart,&rdquo; replied the upholsterer, &ldquo;if you were not a
      woman of virtue and sound understanding we should long ago have been
      separated the one from the other. But I hope that God will continue to
      preserve us in our mutual love, to His own glory and our happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amen to that, my dear,&rdquo; said the good woman, &ldquo;and I hope that on my part
      you will never find aught to blame.&rdquo; (3)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     3  This tale is accounted by most critics and commentators
     to be the best in the <i>Heptameron</i>. Dunlop thinks it may
     have been borrowed from a <i>fabliau</i> composed by some
     <i>Trouvère</i> who had travelled in the East, and points out
     that it corresponds with the story of the <i>Shopkeeper s
     Wife</i> in Nakshebi&rsquo;s Persian Tales (<i>Tooti Nameh</i>). Had it
     been brought to France, however, in the manner suggested it
     would, like other tales, have found its way into the works
     of many sixteenth-century story-writers besides Queen
     Margaret. Such, however, is not the case, and curiously
     enough, so far as we can find, the tale, as given in the
     <i>Heptameron</i>, was never imitated until La Fontaine wrote his
     <i>Servante Justifiée (Contes, livre</i> ii. No. vi.), in the
     opening lines of which he expressly acknowledges his
     indebtedness to the Queen of Navarre.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unbelieving indeed, ladies, must be the man who, after hearing this true
      story, should hold you to be as crafty as men are; though, if we are not
      to wrong either, and to give both man and wife the praise they truly
      deserve, we must needs admit that the better of the two was worth naught.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;was marvellously wicked, for he deceived his
      servant on the one side and his wife on the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you cannot have understood the story,&rdquo; said Hircan. &ldquo;We are told
      that he contented them both in the same morning, and I consider it a
      highly virtuous thing, both for body and mind, to be able to say and do
      that which may make two opposites content.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was doubly wicked,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;to satisfy the simplicity of one
      by falsehood and the wickedness of the other by vice. But I am aware that
      sins, when brought before such judges as you, will always be forgiven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet I promise you,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;that for my own part I shall never
      essay so great and difficult a task, for if I but render <i>you</i>
      content my day will not have been ill spent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If mutual love,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;cannot content the heart, nothing else
      can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In sooth,&rdquo; said Simontault, &ldquo;I think there is no greater grief in the
      world than to love and not be loved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be loved,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;it were needful to turn to such as love.
      Very often, however, those women who will not love are loved the most,
      while those men who love most strongly are loved the least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You remind me,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;of a story which I had not intended to
      bring forward among such good ones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still I pray you tell it us,&rdquo; said Simontault. &ldquo;That will I do right
      willingly,&rdquo; replied Oisille.

      <i>TALE XLVI. (A)</i>.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>A Grey Friar named De Vale, being bidden to dinner at the
     house of the Judge of the Exempts in Angoulême, perceived
     that the Judge&rsquo;s wife (with whom he was in love) went up
     into the garret alone; thinking to surprise her, he followed
     her thither; but she dealt him such a kick in the stomach
     that he fell from the top of the stairs to the bottom, and
     fled out of the town to the house of a lady that had such
     great liking for those of his Order (foolishly believing
     them possessed of greater virtues than belong to them), that
     she entrusted him with the correction of her daughter, whom
     he lay with by force instead of chastising her for the sin
     of sloth-fulness, as he had promised her mother he would
     do</i>. (1)

     1  Boaistuau and Gruget omit this tale, and the latter
     replaces it by that numbered XLVI. (B). Count Charles of
     Angoulême having died on January i, 1496, the incidents
     related above must have occurred at an earlier date.&mdash;L.
</pre>
    <p>
      In the town of Angoulême, where Count Charles, father of King Francis,
      often abode, there dwelt a Grey Friar named De Vale, the same being held a
      learned man and a great preacher. One Advent this Friar preached in the
      town in presence of the Count, whereby he won such renown that those who
      knew him eagerly invited him to dine at their houses. Among others that
      did this was the Judge of the Exempts (2) of the county, who had wedded a
      beautiful and virtuous woman. The Friar was dying for love of her, yet
      lacked the hardihood to tell her so; nevertheless she perceived the truth,
      and held him in derision.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     2  The <i>Exempt</i> was a police officer, and the functions of
     the <i>Juge des Exempts</i> were akin to those of a police
     magistrate.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      After he had given several tokens of his wanton purpose, he one day espied
      her going up into the garret alone. Thinking to surprise her, he followed,
      but hearing his footsteps she turned and asked whither he was going. &ldquo;I am
      going after you,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;to tell you a secret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, good father,&rdquo; said the Judge&rsquo;s wife. &ldquo;I will have no secret converse
      with such as you. If you come up any higher, you will be sorry for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seeing that she was alone, he gave no heed to her words, but hastened up
      after her. She, however, was a woman of spirit, and when she saw the Friar
      at the top of the staircase, she gave him a kick in the stomach, and with
      the words, &ldquo;Down! down! sir,&rdquo; (3) cast him from the top to the bottom. The
      poor father was so greatly ashamed at this, that, forgetting the hurt he
      had received in falling, he fled out of the town as fast as he was able.
      He felt sure that the lady would not conceal the matter from her husband;
      and indeed she did not, nor yet from the Count and Countess, so that the
      Friar never again durst come into their presence.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     3  The French words here are &ldquo;<i>Dévaliez, dévaliez,
     monsieur</i>,&rdquo; whilst MS. No. 1520 gives, &ldquo;<i>Monsieur de Vale,
     dévalés</i>.&rdquo; In either case there is evidently a play upon the
     friar&rsquo;s name, which was possibly pronounced Vallès or
     Vallès. Adrien de Valois, it maybe pointed out, rendered his
     name in Latin as <i>Valesius</i>; the county of Valois and that
     of Valais are one and the same; we continue calling the old
     French kings Valois, as their name was written, instead of
     Valais as it was pronounced, as witness, for instance, the
     nickname given to Henry III. by the lampooners of the
     League, &ldquo;<i>Henri dévalé</i>.&rdquo; See also <i>post</i>, Tale XLVI. (B),
     note 2.&mdash;M. and Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      To complete his wickedness, he repaired to the house of a lady who
      preferred the Grey Friars to all other folk, and, after preaching a sermon
      or two before her, he cast his eyes upon her daughter, who was very
      beautiful. And as the maiden did not rise in the morning to hear his
      sermon, he often scolded her in presence of her mother, whereupon the
      latter would say to him&mdash;&ldquo;Would to God, father, that she had some
      taste of the discipline which you monks receive from one another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The good father vowed that if she continued to be so slothful, he would
      indeed give her some of it, and her mother earnestly begged him to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      A day or two afterwards, he entered the lady&rsquo;s apartment, and, not seeing
      her daughter there, asked her where she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She fears you so little,&rdquo; replied the lady, &ldquo;that she is still in bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There can be no doubt,&rdquo; said the Grey Friar, &ldquo;that it is a very evil
      habit in young girls to be slothful. Few people think much of the sin of
      sloth, but for my part, I deem it one of the most dangerous there is, for
      the body as for the soul. You should therefore chastise her for it, and if
      you will give me the matter in charge, I will take good care that she does
      not lie abed at an hour when she ought to be praying to God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The poor lady, believing him to be a virtuous man, begged him to be kind
      enough to correct her daughter, which he at once agreed to do, and, going
      up a narrow wooden staircase, he found the girl all alone in bed. She was
      sleeping very soundly, and while she slept he lay with her by force. The
      poor girl, waking up, knew not whether he were man or devil, but began to
      cry out as loudly as she could, and to call for help to her mother. But
      the latter, standing at the foot of the staircase, cried out to the Friar&mdash;&ldquo;Have
      no pity on her, sir. Give it to her again, and chastise the naughty jade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the Friar had worked his wicked will, he came down to the lady and
      said to her with a face all afire&mdash;&ldquo;I think, madam, that your
      daughter will remember my discipline.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mother thanked him warmly and then went upstairs, where she found her
      daughter making such lamentation as is to be expected from a virtuous
      woman who has suffered from so foul a crime. On learning the truth, the
      mother had search made everywhere for the Friar, but he was already far
      away, nor was he ever afterwards seen in the kingdom of France.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, ladies, with how much security such commissions may be given to
      those that are unfit for them. The correction of men pertains to men and
      that of women to women; for women in the correction of men would be as
      pitiful as men in the correction of women would be cruel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jesus! madam,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;what a base and wicked Friar!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say rather,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;what a foolish and witless mother to be led by
      hypocrisy into allowing so much familiarity to those who ought never to be
      seen except in church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In truth,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;I acknowledge that she was the most foolish
      mother imaginable; had she been as wise as the Judge&rsquo;s wife, she would
      rather have made him come down the staircase than go up. But what can you
      expect? The devil that is half-angel is the most dangerous of all, for he
      is so well able to transform himself into an angel of light, that people
      shrink from suspecting him to be what he really is; and it seems to me
      that persons who are not suspicious are worthy of praise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the same time,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;people ought to suspect the evil that
      is to be avoided, especially those who hold a trust; for it is better to
      suspect an evil that does not exist than by foolish trustfulness to fall
      into one that does. I have never known a woman deceived through being slow
      to believe men&rsquo;s words, but many are there that have been deceived through
      being over prompt in giving credence to falsehood. Therefore I say that
      possible evil cannot be held in too strong suspicion by those that have
      charge of men, women, cities or states; for, however good the watch that
      is kept, wickedness and treachery are prevalent enough, and the shepherd
      who is not vigilant will always be deceived by the wiles of the wolf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still,&rdquo; said Dagoucin, &ldquo;a suspicious person cannot have a perfect friend,
      and many friends have been divided by suspicion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you know any such instance,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;I give you my vote that
      you may relate it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know one,&rdquo; said Dagoucin, &ldquo;which is so strictly true that you will
      needs hear it with pleasure. I will tell you, ladies, when it is that a
      close friendship is most easily severed; &lsquo;tis when the security of
      friendship begins to give place to suspicion. For just as trust in a
      friend is the greatest honour that can be shown him, so is doubt of him a
      still greater dishonour. It proves that he is deemed other than we would
      have him to be, and so causes many close friendships to be broken off, and
      friends to be turned into foes. This you will see from the story that I am
      minded to relate.&rdquo;

      <i>TALE XLVI.(B)</i>.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>Concerning a Grey Friar who made it a great crime on the
     part of husbands to beat their wives</i>. (1)
</pre>
    <p>
      In the town of Angoulême, where Count Charles, father of King Francis,
      often abode, there dwelt a Grey Friar named De Vallès, (2) the same being
      a learned man and a very great preacher. At Advent time this Friar
      preached in the town in presence of the Count, whereby his reputation was
      still further increased.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  This is the tale inserted in Gruget&rsquo;s edition in lieu of
     the previous one.&mdash;Ed.

     2  We had thought that Friar Vallès might possibly be Robert
     de Valle, who at the close of the fifteenth century wrote a
     work entitled <i>Explanatio in Plinium</i>, but find that this
     divine was a Bishop of Rouen, and never belonged to the Grey
     Friars. In Gessner&rsquo;s <i>Biographia Universalis</i>, continued by
     Frisius, mention is made of three learned ecclesiastics of
     the name of Valle living in or about Queen Margaret&rsquo;s time:
     Baptiste de Valle, who wrote on war and duelling; William de
     Valle, who penned a volume entitled <i>De Anima Sorbono</i>; and
     Amant de Valle, a Franciscan minorité born at Toulouse, who
     was the author of numerous philosophical works, the most
     important being <i>Elucidationes Scoti</i>.&mdash;B. J.
</pre>
    <p>
      It happened also that during Advent a hare-brained young fellow, who had
      married a passably handsome young woman, continued none the less to run at
      the least as dissolute a course as did those that were still bachelors.
      The young wife, being advised of this, could not keep silence upon it, so
      that she very often received payment after a different and a prompter
      fashion than she could have wished. For all that, she ceased not to
      persist in lamentation, and sometimes in railing as well; which so
      provoked the young man that he beat her even to bruises and blood.
      Thereupon she cried out yet more loudly than before; and in a like fashion
      all the women of the neighbourhood, knowing the reason of this, could not
      keep silence, but cried out publicly in the streets, saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shame, shame on such husbands! To the devil with them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By good fortune the Grey Friar De Vallès was passing that way and heard
      the noise and the reason of it. He resolved to touch upon it the following
      day in his sermon, and did so. Turning his discourse to the subject of
      marriage and the affection which ought to subsist in it, he greatly
      extolled that condition, at the same time censuring those that offended
      against it, and comparing wedded to parental love. Among other things, he
      said that a husband who beat his wife was in more danger, and would have a
      heavier punishment, than if he had beaten his father or his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if you beat your father or your mother you will be sent
      for penance to Rome; but if you beat your wife, she and all the women of
      the neighbourhood will send you to the devil, that is, to hell. Now look
      you what a difference there is between these two penances. From Rome a man
      commonly returns again, but from hell, oh! from that place, there is no
      return: <i>nulla est redemptio</i>&rdquo; (3)
    </p>
    <p>
      After preaching this sermon, he was informed that the women were making a
      triumph of it, (4) and that their husbands could no longer control them.
      He therefore resolved to set the husbands right just as he had previously
      assisted their wives.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     3  This was the Pope&rsquo;s expression apropos of Messer Biagio,
     whom Michael Angelo had introduced into his &ldquo;Last
     Judgment.&rdquo;&mdash;M.

     4  The French expression is <i>faisaient leur Achilles</i>, the
     nearest equivalent to which in English would probably be
     &ldquo;Hectoring&rdquo; It is curious that the French should have taken
     the name of Achilles and we that of Hector to express the
     same idea of arrogance and bluster.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      With this intent, in one of his sermons he compared women and devil
      together, saying that these were the greatest enemies that man had, that
      they tempted him without ceasing, and that he could not rid himself of
      them, especially of women.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;as far as devils are concerned, if you show them the
      cross they flee away, whereas women, on the contrary, are tamed by it, and
      are made to run hither and thither and cause their husbands countless
      torments. But, good people, know you what you must do? When you find your
      wives afflicting you thus continually, as is their wont, take off the
      handle of the cross and with it drive them away. You will not have made
      this experiment briskly three or four times before you will find
      yourselves the better for it, and see that, even as the devil is driven
      off by the virtue of the cross, so can you drive away and silence your
      wives by virtue of the handle, provided only that it be not attached to
      the cross aforesaid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have here some of the sermons by this reverend De Vallès, of whose
      life I will with good reason relate nothing more. However, I will tell you
      that, whatever face he put upon the matter&mdash;and I knew him&mdash;he
      was much more inclined to the side of the women than to that of the men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet, madam,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;he did not show this in his last sermon,
      in which he instructed the men to ill-treat them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, you do not comprehend his artifice,&rdquo; said Hircan. &ldquo;You are not
      experienced in war and in the use of the stratagems that it requires;
      among these, one of the most important is to kindle strife in the camp of
      the enemy, whereby he becomes far easier to conquer. This master monk well
      knew that hatred and wrath between husband and wife most often cause a
      loose rein to be given to the wife&rsquo;s honour. And when that honour frees
      itself from the guardianship of virtue, it finds itself in the power of
      the wolf before it knows even that it is astray.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However that may be,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;I could not love a man who had
      sown such division between my husband and myself as would lead even to
      blows; for beating banishes love. Yet, by what I have heard, they [the
      friars] can be so mincing when they seek some advantage over a woman, and
      so attractive in their discourse, that I feel sure there would be more
      danger in hearkening to them in secret than in publicly receiving blows
      from a husband in other respects a good one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; said Dagoucin, &ldquo;they have so revealed their plottings in all
      directions, that it is not without reason that they are to be feared; (5)
      although in my opinion persons who are not suspicious are worthy of
      praise.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     5  From this point the dialogue is almost word for word the
     same as that following Tale XLVI. (A).&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the same time,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;people ought to suspect the evil that
      is to be avoided, for it is better to suspect an evil that does not exist
      than by foolish trustfulness to fall into one that does. For my part, I
      have never known a woman deceived by being slow to believe men&rsquo;s words,
      but many are through being too prompt in giving credence to falsehood.
      Therefore I say that possible evil cannot be too strongly suspected by
      those that have charge of men, women, cities or states; for, however good
      may be the watch that is kept, wickedness and treachery are prevalent
      enough, and for this reason the shepherd who is not vigilant will always
      be deceived by the wiles of the wolf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still,&rdquo; said Dagoucin, &ldquo;a suspicious person cannot have a perfect friend,
      and many friends have been parted by bare suspicion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you should know any such instance,&rdquo; thereupon said Oisille, &ldquo;I will
      give you my vote that you may relate it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know one,&rdquo; said Dagoucin, &ldquo;which is so strictly true that you will hear
      it with pleasure. I will tell you, ladies, when it is that close
      friendship is most readily broken off; it is when the security of
      friendship begins to give place to suspicion. For just as to trust a
      friend is the greatest honour one can do him, so is doubt of him the
      greatest dishonour, inasmuch as it proves that he is deemed other than one
      would have him to be, and in this wise many close friendships are broken
      off and friends turned into foes. This you will see from the story that I
      am now about to relate.&rdquo;

      <i>TALE XLVII</i>.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>Two gentlemen lined in such perfect friendship that for a
     great while they had everything excepting a wife in common,
     until one was married, when without cause he began to
     suspect his companion, who, in vexation at being wrongfully
     suspected, withdrew his friendship, and did not rest till he
     had made the other a cuckold</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      Not far from the province of Le Perche (1) there dwelt two gentlemen who
      from the days of their childhood had lived in such perfect friendship that
      they had but one heart, one house, one bed, one table, and one purse. They
      continued living in this perfect friendship for a long time, without there
      ever being between them any wish or word such as might betray that they
      were different persons; so truly did they live not merely like two
      brothers but like one individual man.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  Between Normandy and Maine. Its chief town was Mortagne.
</pre>
    <p>
      Of the two one married, yet did not on that account abate his friendship
      for his fellow or cease to live with him as had been his wont. And
      whenever they chanced to lodge where room was scanty, he failed not to
      make him sleep with himself and his wife; (2) though he did, in truth,
      himself lie in the middle. Their goods were all in common, so that neither
      the marriage nor aught else that might betide could impair their perfect
      friendship.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     2  To do honour to a guest it was then a common practice to
     invite him to share the same bed as one&rsquo;s self and one&rsquo;s
     wife. In this wise, long after Queen Margaret s time, we
     find Louis XIII. sharing the bed of the Duke and Duchess of
     Luynes. Tale vii. of the <i>Cent Nouvelles Nouvelles</i>
     (imitated in Malespini&rsquo;s <i>Ducento Novelle</i> and the <i>Joyeuses
     Adventures et nouvelles récréations</i>) relates what befell a
     Paris goldsmith who took a carter to bed with him and his
     spouse, and neglected to follow the usual custom of sleeping
     in the middle. In Queen Margaret&rsquo;s time, it may be added,
     the so-called &ldquo;beds of honour&rdquo; in the abodes of noblemen and
     gentlemen were large enough to accommodate four or five
     persons.&mdash;B. J. and Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      But after some time, worldly happiness, which is ever changeful in its
      nature, could no longer abide in this too happy household. The husband,
      without cause, lost the confidence that he had in his friend and in his
      wife, and, being unable to conceal the truth from the latter, spoke to her
      with angry words. At this she was greatly amazed, for he had charged her
      in all things save one to treat his friend as she did himself, and now he
      forbade her to speak with him except it were before others. She made the
      matter known to her husband&rsquo;s friend, who did not believe her, knowing as
      he well did that he had never purposed doing aught to grieve his comrade.
      And as he was wont to hide nothing from him, he told him what he had
      heard, begging him not to conceal the truth, for neither in this nor in
      any other matter had he any desire to occasion the severance of the
      friendship which had so long subsisted between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The married gentleman assured him that he had never thought of such a
      thing, and that those who had spread such a rumour had foully lied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon his comrade replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I well know that jealousy is a passion as insupportable as love, and were
      you inclined to jealousy even with regard to myself, I should not blame
      you, for you could not help it. But there is a thing that is in your power
      of which I should have reason to complain, and that is the concealment of
      your distemper from me, seeing that never before was thought, feeling or
      opinion concealed between us. If I were in love with your wife, you should
      not impute it to me as a crime, for love is not a fire that I can hold in
      my hand to do with it what I will; but if it were so and I concealed it
      from you, and sought by demonstration to make it known to your wife, I
      should be the wickedest comrade that ever lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As far as I myself am concerned, I can truly assure you that, although
      she is an honourable and virtuous woman, she is the last of all the women
      I have ever seen upon whom, even though she were not yours, my fancy would
      light. But even though there be no occasion to do so, I ask you, if you
      have the smallest possible feeling of suspicion, to tell me of it, that I
      may so act as to prevent a friendship that has lasted so long from being
      severed for the sake of a woman. For, even if I loved her more dearly than
      aught in the world beside, I would never speak to her of it, seeing that I
      set your honour before aught else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His comrade swore to him the strongest oaths he could muster, that he had
      never thought of such a thing, and begged him to act in his house as he
      had been used to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will I,&rdquo; the other replied, &ldquo;but if after this should you harbour an
      evil opinion of me and conceal it or bear me ill-will, I will continue no
      more in fellowship with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some time afterwards, whilst they were living together as had been their
      wont, the married gentleman again fell into stronger suspicion than ever,
      and commanded his wife to no longer show the same countenance to his
      friend as before. This she at once made known to her husband&rsquo;s comrade,
      and begged that he would of his own motion abstain from holding speech
      with her, since she had been charged to do the like towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman perceived from her words and from divers tokens on the part
      of his comrade that the latter had not kept his promise, and so said to
      him in great wrath&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If, comrade, you are jealous, &lsquo;tis a natural thing, but, after the oaths
      you swore to me, I must needs be angered that you have used such
      concealment towards me. I had always thought that neither obstacle nor
      mean intervened between your heart and mine, but to my exceeding sorrow,
      and with no fault on my part, I see that the reverse is true. Not only are
      you most jealous of your wife and of me, but you seek to hide your
      distemper from me, until at last it must wholly turn to hate, and the
      dearest love that our time has known become the deadliest enmity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have done all I could to avoid this mishap, but since you suspect me of
      being so wicked and the opposite of what I have always proved towards you,
      I give you my oath and word that I will indeed be such a one as you deem
      me, and that I will never rest until I have had from your wife that which
      you believe I seek from her. So I bid you beware of me henceforward, for,
      since suspicion has destroyed your friendship for me, resentment will
      destroy mine for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Although his comrade tried to persuade him of the contrary, he would no
      longer believe him, but removed his portion of the furniture and goods
      that had been in common between them. And so their hearts were as widely
      sundered as they had before been closely united, and the unmarried
      gentleman never rested until, as he had promised, he had made his comrade
      a cuckold. (3)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     3  The idea developed in this tale, that of bringing to pass
     by one&rsquo;s own actions the thing one fears and seeks to avoid
     or prevent, has much analogy with that embodied in the
     &ldquo;novel of the Curious Impertinent&rdquo; which Cervantes
     introduces into <i>Don Quixote</i> (Part I. chaps, xxviii.,
     xxix). In this tale it will be remembered Anselmo and
     Lothario are represented as being two such close friends as
     the gentlemen who figured in Queen Margaret&rsquo;s tale. Anselmo
     marries, however, and seized with an insane desire to test
     the virtue of his wife, Camilla, by exposing her to
     temptation, urges Lothario to pay court to her. Lothario at
     first resists these solicitations, pointing out the folly of
     such an enterprise, but his friend entreats him so
     pressingly that he finally consents, and in the sequel the
     passion which he at first simulates for Camilla becomes a
     real one and leads to his seducing her and carrying her
     away, with the result that both the wretched Anselmo and his
     wife soon die of grief, whilst Lothario betakes himself to
     the wars and perishes in battle.&mdash;M. &amp; Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thus, ladies, may it fare with those who wrongfully suspect their wives
      of evil. Many men make of them what they suspect them to be, for a
      virtuous woman is more readily overcome by despair than by all the
      pleasures on earth. And if any one says that suspicion is love, I give him
      nay, for although it results from love as do ashes from fire, it kills it
      nevertheless in the same way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not think,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;that anything can be more grievous to
      either man or woman than to be suspected of that which is contrary to
      fact. For my own part, nothing could more readily prompt me to sever
      fellowship with my friends than such suspicion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;woman is without rational excuse who
      revenges herself for her husband&rsquo;s suspicion by her own shame. It is as
      though a man should thrust his sword through his own body, because unable
      to slay his foe, or should bite his own fingers because he cannot scratch
      him. She would have done better had she spoken to the gentleman no more,
      and so shown her husband how wrongly he had suspected her; for time would
      have softened them both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still &lsquo;twas done like a woman of spirit,&rdquo; said Ennasuite. &ldquo;If many women
      acted in the same way, their husbands would not be so outrageous as they
      are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For all that,&rdquo; said Longarine, &ldquo;patience gives a woman the victory in the
      end, and chastity brings her praise, and more we should not desire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; said Ennasuite, &ldquo;a woman may be unchaste and yet commit no
      sin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How may that be?&rdquo; said Oisille.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When she mistakes another man for her husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;is so foolish that she cannot clearly tell
      the difference between her husband and another man, whatever disguise the
      latter may wear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There have been and still will be,&rdquo; said Ennasuite, &ldquo;a few deceived in
      this fashion, and therefore still innocent and free from sin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you know of such a one,&rdquo; said Dagoucin, &ldquo;I give you my vote that you
      may tell us about her, for I think it very strange that innocence and sin
      can go together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, then,&rdquo; said Ennasuite. &ldquo;If, ladies, the foregoing tales have not
      sufficiently warned you of the danger of lodging in our houses those who
      call us worldly and consider themselves as something holy and far worthier
      than we, I will give you yet a further instance of it, that you may see by
      the errors into which those fall who trust them too much that not only are
      they human like others, but that there is something devilish in their
      nature, passing the ordinary wickedness of men. This you will learn from
      the following story.&rdquo;

      <i>TALE XLVIII</i>.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>The older and wickeder of two Grey Friars, who were lodged
     in an inn where the marriage of the host&rsquo;s daughter was
     being celebrated, perceived the bride being led away,
     whereupon he went and took the place of the bridegroom
     whilst the latter was still dancing with the company</i>. (1)

     1  We have already had an instance of a friar stealing into
     a wife&rsquo;s bed at night-time, in the husband&rsquo;s absence (see
     <i>ante</i>, vol. iii., tale xxili.). For a similar incident see
     the <i>Cent Nouvelles Nouvelles</i>, No. xxx.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      At an inn, in a village of the land of Perigort, there was celebrated the
      marriage of a maiden of the house, at which all the kinsfolk and friends
      strove to make as good cheer as might be. On the day of the wedding there
      arrived at the inn two Grey Friars, to whom supper was given in their own
      room, since it was not meet for those of their condition to be present at
      a wedding. However, the chief of the two, who had the greater authority
      and craft, resolved that, since he was shut out from the board, he would
      share the bed, and in this way play them one of the tricks of his trade.
    </p>
    <p>
      When evening was come, and the dances were begun, the Grey Friar continued
      to observe the bride for a long time, and found her very handsome and to
      his taste. Then, inquiring carefully of the serving-woman concerning the
      room in which she was to lie, he found that it was close to his own, at
      which he was well pleased; and so good a watch did he keep in order to
      work his end, that he perceived the bride being led from the hall by the
      old women, as is the custom. As it was yet very early, the bridegroom
      would not leave the dance, in which he was so greatly absorbed that he
      seemed to have altogether forgotten his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not so the Friar, for, as soon as his ears told him that the bride was in
      bed, he put off his grey robe and went and took the husband&rsquo;s place. Being
      fearful of discovery, however, he stayed but a very short time, and then
      went to the end of a passage where his comrade, who was keeping watch for
      him, signed to him that the husband was dancing-still.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Friar, who had not yet satisfied his wicked lust, thereupon went back
      to bed with the bride, until his comrade gave him a signal that it was
      time to leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bridegroom afterwards came to bed, and his wife, who had been so
      tormented by the Friar that she desired naught but rest, could not help
      saying to him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you resolved never to sleep or do anything but torment me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The unhappy husband, who had but just come in, was greatly astonished at
      this, and asked what torment he had given her, seeing that he had not left
      the dance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A pretty dance!&rdquo; said the poor girl. &ldquo;This is the third time that you
      have come to bed. I think you would do better to sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The husband was greatly astonished on hearing these words, and set aside
      thought of everything else in order that he might learn the truth of what
      had passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When his wife had told him the story, he at once suspected the Grey Friars
      who were lodged in the house, and forthwith rising, he went into their
      room, which was close beside his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not finding them there, he began to call out for help in so loud a voice
      that he speedily drew together all his friends, who, when they had heard
      the tale, assisted him with candles, lanterns, and all the dogs of the
      village to hunt for the Grey Friars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not finding them in the house, they made all diligence, and so caught them
      among the vines, where they treated them as they deserved; for, after
      soundly beating them, they cut off their arms and legs, and left them
      among the vines to the care of Bacchus and Venus, of whom they had been
      better disciples than of St. Francis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be not amazed, ladies, if such folk, being cut off from our usual mode of
      life, do things of which adventurers (2) even would be ashamed. Wonder
      rather that they do no worse when God withdraws his hand from them, for so
      little does the habit make the monk, that it often unmakes him through the
      pride it lends him. For my own part, I go not beyond the religion that is
      taught by St. James, who has told us to &lsquo;keep the heart pure and unspotted
      toward God, and to show all charity to our neighbours.&rsquo;&rdquo;(3)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     2 This is an allusion to the dismissed French Swiss, and
     German lansquenets who roamed about France in little bands,
     kidnapping, plundering, and at times hiring themselves out
     as spadassins. These men, the pests of the country, were
     commonly known by the name of adventurers.&mdash;B. J.

     3  &ldquo;Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is
     this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction
     and to keep himself unspotted from the world.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>James</i> i.
     27.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;shall we never have done with tales about these
      tiresome Grey Friars?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then said Ennasuite&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If, ladies, princes and gentlemen are not spared, the Grey Friars, it
      seems to me, are highly honoured by being noticed. They are so useless
      that, were it not that they often do evil things worthy of remembrance,
      they would never even be mentioned; and, as the saying goes, it is better
      to do evil than to do nothing at all. Besides, the more varied the flowers
      the handsomer will our posy be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will promise not to be angry with me,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;I will tell
      you the story of a great lady whose wantonness was so extreme that you
      will forgive the poor friar for having taken what he needed, where he was
      able to find it, seeing that she, who had enough to eat, nevertheless
      sought for dainties in too monstrous a fashion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since we have sworn to speak the truth,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;we have also
      sworn to hear it. You may therefore speak with freedom, for the evil
      things that we tell of men and women are not uttered to shame those that
      are spoken of in the story, but to take away all trust in created beings,
      by revealing the trouble to which these are liable, and this to the end
      that we may fix and rest our hope on Him alone who is perfect, and without
      whom every man is only imperfection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;I will relate my story without fear.&rdquo;

      <i>TALE XLIX</i>.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>Same French gentlemen, perceiving that the King their
     master was exceedingly well treated by a foreign Countess
     whom he loved, ventured to speak to her, and sought her with
     such success, that one after another they had from her what
     they desired, each, however, believing that he alone
     possessed the happiness in which all the others shared. And
     this being discovered by one of their number, they all
     plotted together to be revenged on her; but, as she showed a
     fair countenance and treated them no worse than before, they
     brought away in their own bosoms the shame which they had
     thought to bring upon her</i>. (1)
</pre>
    <p>
      At the Court of King Charles&mdash;which Charles I shall not mention, for
      the sake of the lady of whom I wish to speak, and whom I shall not call by
      her own name&mdash;there was a Countess of excellent lineage, (2) but a
      foreigner. And as novelties ever please, this lady, both for the
      strangeness of her attire and for its exceeding richness, was observed by
      all. Though she was not to be ranked among the most beautiful, she
      possessed gracefulness, together with a noble assurance that could not be
      surpassed; and, moreover, her manner of speech and her seriousness were to
      match, so that there was none but feared to accost her excepting the King,
      who loved her exceedingly. That he might have still more intimate converse
      with her, he gave some mission to the Count, her husband, which kept him
      away for a long time, and meanwhile the King made right good cheer with
      his wife.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  The incidents here related must have occurred during the
     reign of Charles VIII., probably in or about 1490.&mdash;L.

     2  This Countess cannot be identified. She was probably the
     wife of one of the many Italian noblemen, like the
     Caraccioli and San Severini, who entered the French service
     about the time of the conquest of Naples. Brantôme alludes
     to the story in his <i>Dames Galantes</i> (Fourth Discourse) but
     gives no names.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      Several of the King&rsquo;s gentlemen, knowing that their master was well
      treated by her, took courage to speak to her, and among the rest was one
      called Astillon, (3) a bold man and graceful of bearing.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     3  This is James de Chastillon, not, however, J. Gaucher de
     Chastillon, &ldquo;King of Yvetot,&rdquo; as M. de Lincy supposes, but
     J. de Coligny-Chastillon, as has been pointed out by M.
     Frank. Brantôme devotes the Nineteenth Discourse of his
     <i>Capitaines françois</i> to this personage, and says: &ldquo;He had
     been one of the great favourites and <i>mignons</i> of King
     Charles VIII., even at the time of the journey to the
     kingdom of Naples; and &lsquo;twas then said, &lsquo;Chastillon,
     Bourdillon and Bonneval [see post, note 5] govern the royal
     blood.&rsquo;&rdquo; Wounded in April 1512 at the battle of Ravenna,
     &ldquo;the most bloody battle of the century,&rdquo; he was removed to
     Ferrara, where he died (May 25). He was the second husband
     of Blanche de Tournon, Lady of Honour to Queen Margaret,
     respecting whom see <i>ante</i>, vol. i. pp. 84-5, 122-4, and
     vol. iv. p. 144, note 2.&mdash;L., F. and Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      At first she treated him so seriously, threatening to tell of him to the
      King his master, that he well-nigh became afraid of her. However, as he
      had not been wont to fear the threats even of the most redoubtable
      captains, he would not suffer himself to be moved by hers, but pressed her
      so closely that she at last consented to speak with him in private, and
      taught him the manner in which he should come to her apartment. This he
      failed not to do, and, in order that the King might be without suspicion
      of the truth, he craved permission to go on a journey, and set out from
      the Court. On the very first day, however, he left all his following and
      returned at night to receive fulfilment of the promises that the Countess
      had made him. These she kept so much to his satisfaction, that he was
      content to remain shut up in a closet for five or six days, without once
      going out, and living only on restoratives.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the week that he lay in hiding, one of his companions called
      Durassier (4) made love to the Countess. At the beginning she spoke to
      this new lover, as she had spoken to the first, with harsh and haughty
      speech that grew milder day by day, insomuch that when the time was come
      for dismissing the first prisoner, she put the second into his place.
      While he was there, another companion of his, named Valnebon, (5) did the
      same as the former two, and after these there came yet two or three more
      to lodge in the sweet prison.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     4  This in all probability is the doughty James Galliot de
     Genouillac, who&mdash;much in the same way as in our own times
     the names of the &ldquo;Iron Duke&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Man of Iron&rdquo; have been
     bestowed on Wellington and Bismarck&mdash;was called by his
     contemporaries the &ldquo;Seigneur d&rsquo;Acier&rdquo; or &ldquo;Steel Lord,&rdquo;
      whence &ldquo;Durassier&rdquo;&mdash;hard steel. Born in Le Quercy in or
     about 1466, Genouillac accompanied Charles VIII. on his
     Italian expeditions, and, according to Brantôme, surpassed
     all others in valour and influence. He greatly distinguished
     himself at the battle of Fornova (1495), and in 1515 we find
     him one of the chief commanders of the French artillery. For
     the great skill he displayed at Marignano he was appointed
     Grand Master of the Artillery and Seneschal of Armagnac, and
     he subsequently became Grand Equerry of France. At Pavia,
     where he again commanded the artillery, he would have swept
     away the Spaniards had not the French impetuously charged
     upon them, preventing him from firing his pieces. Most of
     the latter he contrived to save, severe as was the defeat,
     and he effectually protected the retreat of the Duke of
     Alençon and the Count of Clermont into France. Genouillac
     died in 1546, a year after he had been appointed Governor of
     Languedoc.&mdash;B. J. and Ed.

     5  Valnebon is an anagram of the name Bonneval, and Queen
     Margaret evidently refers here to a member of the Bonneval
     family. In the time of Charles VIII. this illustrious
     Limousin house had two principal members, Anthony, one of
     the leading counsellors of that king (as of his predecessor
     Louis XI. and his successor Louis XII.), and Germain, also a
     royal counsellor and chamberlain. The heroes of the above
     story being military men and old friends and comrades, it is
     probable that the reference is to Germain de Bonneval, he,
     like Chastillon and Genouillac, having accompanied Charles
     VIII. on his expedition into Italy. Germain de Bonneval,
     moreover, was one of the seven noblemen who fought at the
     battle of Fornova, clad and armed exactly like the French
     king. He perished at the memorable defeat of Pavia in 1525.
     From him descended, in a direct line, the famous eighteenth
     century adventurer, Claud Alexander, Count de Bonneval.&mdash;B.
     J. and Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      This manner of life continued for a long time, and was so skilfully
      contrived that none of the lovers knew aught of the others; and although
      they were aware of the love that each of them bore the lady, there was not
      one but believed himself to be the only successful suitor, and laughed at
      his comrades who, as he thought, had failed to win such great happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day when the gentlemen aforesaid were at a banquet where they made
      right good cheer, they began to speak of their several fortunes and of the
      prisons in which they had lain during the wars. Valnebon, however, who
      found it a hard task to conceal the great good fortune he had met with,
      began saying to his comrades&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know not what prisons have been yours, but for my own part, for love of
      one wherein I once lay, I shall all my life long give praise and honour to
      the rest. I think that no pleasure on earth comes near that of being kept
      a prisoner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Astillon, who had been the first captive, had a suspicion of the prison
      that he meant, and replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What gaoler, Valnebon, man or woman, treated you so well that you became
      so fond of your prison?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whoever the gaoler may have been,&rdquo; said Valnebon, &ldquo;my prisonment was so
      pleasant that I would willingly have had it last longer. Never was I
      better treated or more content.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Durassier, who was a man of few words, clearly perceived that they were
      discussing the prison in which he had shared like the rest; so he said to
      Valnebon&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On what meats were you fed in the prison that you praise so highly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What meats?&rdquo; said Valnebon. &ldquo;The King himself has none better or more
      nourishing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I should also like to know,&rdquo; said Durassier, &ldquo;whether your keeper
      made you earn your bread properly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Valnebon, suspecting that he had been understood, could not hold from
      swearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God&rsquo;s grace!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Had I indeed comrades where I believed myself
      alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Perceiving this dispute, wherein he had part like the rest, Astillon
      laughed and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We all serve one master, and have been comrades and friends from boyhood;
      if, then, we are comrades in the same good fortune, we can but laugh at
      it. But, to see whether what I imagine be true, pray let me question you,
      and do you confess the truth to me; for if that which I fancy has befallen
      us, it is as amusing an adventure as could be found in any book.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They all swore to tell the truth if the matter were such as they could not
      deny.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then said he to them&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you my own fortune, and you will tell me, ay or nay, if yours
      has been the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this they all agreed, whereupon he said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I asked leave of the King to go on a journey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So,&rdquo; they replied, &ldquo;did we.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I was two leagues from the Court, I left all my following and went
      and yielded myself up prisoner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We,&rdquo; they replied, &ldquo;did the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remained,&rdquo; said Astillon, &ldquo;for seven or eight days, and lay in a closet
      where I was fed on nothing but restoratives and the choicest viands that I
      ever ate. At the end of a week, those who held me captive suffered me to
      depart much weaker in body than I had been on my arrival.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They all swore that the like had happened to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My imprisonment,&rdquo; said Astillon, &ldquo;began on such a day and finished on
      such another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mine,&rdquo; thereupon said Durassier, &ldquo;began on the very day that yours ended,
      and lasted until such a day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Valnebon, who was losing patience, began to swear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Sblood!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;from what I can see, I, who thought myself the first
      and only one, was the third, for I went in on such a day and came out on
      such another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Three others, who were at the table, swore that they had followed in like
      order.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, since that is so,&rdquo; said Astillon, &ldquo;I will mention the condition of
      our gaoler. She is married, and her husband is a long way off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis even she,&rdquo; they all replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, to put us out of our pain,&rdquo; said Astillon, &ldquo;I, who was first
      enrolled, shall also be the first to name her. It was my lady the
      Countess, she who was so extremely haughty that in conquering her
      affection I felt as though I had conquered Cæsar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      [Said Valnebon&mdash;(6)]
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     6  It is probable that the angry Valnebon is speaking here,
     and that his name has been accidentally omitted from the
     MSS. At all events the three subsequent paragraphs show that
     these remarks are not made by Astillon, who declines the
     other speaker&rsquo;s advice, and proposes a scheme of his own.&mdash;
     Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the devil with the jade, who gave us so much toil, and made us believe
      ourselves so fortunate in winning her! Never was there such wantonness,
      for while she kept one in hiding she was practising upon another, so that
      she might never be without diversion. I would rather die than suffer her
      to go unpunished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Each thereupon asked him what he thought ought to be done to her, saying
      that they were all ready to do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that we ought to tell the King our master, who prizes
      her as though she were a goddess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By no means,&rdquo; said Astillon; &ldquo;we are ourselves able to take vengeance
      upon her, without calling in the aid of our master. Let us all be present
      to-morrow when she goes to mass, each of us wearing an iron chain about
      his neck. Then, when she enters the church, we will greet her as shall be
      fitting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This counsel was highly approved by the whole company, and each provided
      himself with an iron chain. The next morning they all went, dressed in
      black and with their iron chains twisted like collars round their necks,
      to meet the Countess as she was going to church. And as soon as she saw
      them thus attired, she began to laugh and asked them&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whither go such doleful folk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said Astillon, &ldquo;we are come to attend you as poor captive slaves
      constrained to do your service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Countess, feigning not to understand, replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not my captives, and I cannot understand that you have more
      occasion than others to do me service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon Valnebon stepped forward and said to her&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After eating your bread for so long a time, we should be ungrateful
      indeed if we did not serve you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made excellent show of not understanding the matter, thinking by this
      seriousness to confound them; but they pursued their discourse in such
      sort that she saw that all was discovered. So she immediately devised a
      means of baffling them, for, having lost honour and conscience, she would
      in no wise take to herself the shame that they thought to bring upon her.
      On the contrary, like one who set her pleasure before all earthly honour,
      she neither changed her countenance nor treated them worse than before,
      whereat they were so confounded, that they carried away in their own
      bosoms the shame they had thought to bring upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If, ladies, you do not consider this story enough to prove that women are
      as bad as men, I will seek out others of the same kind to relate to you.
      Nevertheless I think that this one will suffice to show you that a woman
      who has lost shame is far bolder to do evil than a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was not a woman in the company that heard this story, who did not
      make as many signs of the cross as if all the devils in hell were before
      her eyes. However, Oisille said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ladies, let us humble ourselves at hearing of so terrible a circumstance,
      and the more so as she who is forsaken by God becomes like him with whom
      she unites; for even as those who cleave to God have His spirit within
      them, so is it with those that cleave to His opposite, whence it comes
      that nothing can be more brutish than one devoid of the Spirit of God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever the poor lady may have done,&rdquo; said Ennasuite, &ldquo;I nevertheless
      cannot praise the men who boasted of their imprisonment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my opinion,&rdquo; said Longarine, &ldquo;that a man finds it as troublesome to
      conceal his good fortune as to pursue it. There is never a hunter but
      delights to wind his horn over his quarry, nor lover but would fain have
      credit for his conquest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Simontault, &ldquo;is an opinion which I would hold to be heretical
      in presence of all the Inquisitors of the Faith, for there are more men
      than women that can keep a secret, and I know right well that some might
      be found who would rather forego their happiness than have any human being
      know of it. For this reason has the Church, like a wise mother, ordained
      men to be confessors and not women, seeing that the latter can conceal
      nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not the reason,&rdquo; said Oisille; &ldquo;it is because women are such
      enemies of vice that they would not grant absolution with the same
      readiness as is shown by men, and would be too stern in their penances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they were as stern in their penances,&rdquo; said Dagoucin, &ldquo;as they are in
      their responses, they would reduce far more sinners to despair than they
      would draw to salvation; and so the Church has in every sort well
      ordained. But, for all that, I will not excuse the gentlemen who thus
      boasted of their prison, for never was a man honoured by speaking evil of
      a woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since they all fared alike,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;it seems to me that they did
      well to console one another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said Geburon, &ldquo;they should never have acknowledged it for the sake
      of their own honour. The books of the Round Table (7) teach us that it is
      not to the honour of a worthy knight to overcome one that is good for
      naught.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     7  Queen Margaret was well acquainted with these (see
     <i>ante</i>, vol. iii. p. 48). In a list drawn up after her
     father&rsquo;s death, of the two hundred volumes of books in his
     library, a most remarkable one for the times, we find
     specified several copies of &ldquo;Lancelot,&rdquo; &ldquo;Tristan,&rdquo; &amp;c, some
     in MS. with miniatures and illuminated letters, and others
     printed on parchment. Besides numerous religious writings,
     volumes of Aristotle, Ovid, Mandeville, Dante, the
     Chronicles of St. Denis, and the &ldquo;Book of the Great Khan,
     bound in cloth of gold,&rdquo; the library contained various works
     of a character akin to that of the <i>Heptameron</i>. For
     instance, a copy of the <i>Cent Nouvelles Nouvelles</i> in print;
     a French translation of Poggio&rsquo;s <i>Facetio</i>, also in print,
     and two copies of Boccaccio in MS., one of them bound in
     purple velvet, and richly illuminated, each page having a
     border of blue and silver. This last if still in existence
     would be very valuable.&mdash;Eu.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am amazed,&rdquo; said Longarine, &ldquo;that the unhappy woman did not die of
      shame in presence of her captives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those who have lost shame,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;can hardly ever recover it,
      excepting, however, she that has forgotten it through deep love. Of such
      have I seen many return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;that you must have seen the return of as many as
      went, for deep love in a woman is difficult to find.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not of your opinion,&rdquo; said Longarine; &ldquo;I think that there are some
      women who have loved to death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So exceedingly do I desire to hear a tale of that kind,&rdquo; said Hircan,
      &ldquo;that I give you my vote in order to learn of a love in women that I had
      never deemed them to possess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if you hearken,&rdquo; said Longarine, &ldquo;you will believe, and will see
      that there is no stronger passion than love. But while it prompts one to
      almost impossible enterprises for the sake of winning some portion of
      happiness in this life, so does it more than any other passion reduce that
      man or woman to despair, who loses the hope of gaining what is longed for.
      This indeed you will see from the following story.&rdquo;

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>Messire John Peter for a long time wooed in vain a
     neighbour of his by whom he was sorely smitten, and to
     divert his humour withdrew for a few days from the sight of
     her; but this brought so deep a melancholy upon him that the
     doctors ordered him to be bled. The lady, who knew whence
     his distemper proceeded, then thought to save his life, but
     did indeed hasten his death, by granting him that which she
     had always refused. Then, reflecting that she was herself
     the cause of the loss of so perfect a lover, she dealt
     herself a sword-thrust that made her a partner in his fate</i>.
     (1)
</pre>
    <p>
      In the town of Cremona not long ago there lived a gentleman called Messire
      John Peter, (2) who had long loved a lady that dwelt near to his own
      house; but strive as he might he was never able to have of her the reply
      that he desired, albeit he loved her with his whole heart. Being greatly
      grieved and troubled at this, the poor gentleman withdrew into his lodging
      with the resolve that he would no longer vainly pursue the happiness the
      quest of which was devouring his life; and accordingly, to divert his
      humour, he passed a few days without seeing her. This caused him to fall
      into deep sadness, so that his countenance was no longer the same. His
      kinsfolk summoned the doctors, who, finding that his face was growing
      yellow, thought that he had some obstruction of the liver and ordered a
      blood-letting.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  The incidents here narrated probably occurred in or about
     1544.&mdash;L.

     2  &ldquo;Jehan Piètre&rdquo; (Pietro) in the MSS.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      The lady, who had dealt so sternly with him, knew very well that his
      sickness was caused by her refusal alone, and she sent to him an old woman
      in whom she trusted, to tell him that, since she saw his love to be
      genuine and unfeigned, she was now resolved to grant him all that which
      she had refused him so long. She had therefore devised a means to leave
      her house and go to a place where he might privately see her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman, who that same morning had been bled in the arm, found
      himself better cured by this message than by any medicine or bloodletting
      he could have had, and he sent word that he would be at the place without
      fail at the hour she had appointed. He added that she had wrought an
      evident miracle, since with one word she had cured a man of a sickness for
      which all the doctors were not able to find a remedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The longed-for evening being come, the gentleman repaired to the appointed
      place with such extreme joy as must needs come soon to an end, since
      increase of it were not possible. He had waited but a short time after his
      arrival, when she whom he loved more dearly than his own soul came to meet
      him. He did not occupy himself with making long speeches, for the fire
      that consumed him prompted him to seek with all speed that which he could
      scarcely believe to be at last within his power. But whilst, intoxicated
      beyond measure with love and joy, he was in one direction seeking a cure
      that would give him life, he brought to pass in another the hastening of
      his death; for, heedless of himself for his sweetheart&rsquo;s sake, he
      perceived not that his arm became unbound, and that the newly-opened wound
      discharged so much blood that he was, poor gentleman, completely bathed in
      it. Thinking, however, that his weakness had been caused by his excess, he
      bethought himself of returning home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then love, which had too closely united them, so dealt with him that, as
      he was parting from his sweetheart, his soul parted from his body, and, by
      reason of his great loss of blood, he fell dead at his lady&rsquo;s feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      She, on her side, stood there in astonishment, contemplating the loss of
      so perfect a lover, of whose death she had herself been the sole cause.
      Reflecting, on the other hand, on the shame and sorrow that would be hers
      if the dead body were found in her house, she carried it, with a
      serving-woman whom she trusted, into the street in order that the matter
      might not be known. Nevertheless, she felt that she could not leave it
      there alone. Taking up the dead man&rsquo;s sword, she was fain to share his
      fate, and, indeed, to punish her heart, which had been the cause of all
      his woe, she pierced it through and through, so that her dead body fell
      upon that of her lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      When her father and mother came out of their house in the morning, they
      found this pitiful sight, and, after making such mourning as was natural,
      they buried the lovers together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thus, ladies, may it be seen that excessive love brings with it other
      woe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is what I like to see,&rdquo; said Simontault, &ldquo;a love so equal that when
      one died the other could not live. Had I, by the grace of God, found such
      a mistress, I think that none could ever have ioved her more perfectly
      than I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet am I of opinion,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;that you would not have been so
      blinded by love as not to bind up your arm better than he did. The days
      are gone when men were wont to forget their lives for the ladies&rsquo; sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But those are not gone,&rdquo; said Simontault, &ldquo;when ladies are apt to forget
      their lovers&rsquo; lives for their pleasure&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Ennasuite, &ldquo;that there is no living woman that can take
      pleasure in the death of a man, no, not even though he were her enemy.
      Still, if men will indeed kill themselves, the ladies cannot prevent
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; said Saffredent, &ldquo;she that denies the gift of bread to a
      poor starving man is held to be a murderess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If your requests,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;were as reasonable as those of a poor
      man seeking to supply his needs, it would be over cruel of the ladies to
      refuse you. God be thanked, however, your sickness kills none but such as
      must of necessity die within the year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not understand, madam,&rdquo; said Saffredent, &ldquo;that there can be any
      greater need than that which causes all others to be forgotten. When love
      is deep, no bread and no meat whatsoever can be thought of save the glance
      and speech of the woman whom one loves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you were allowed to fast,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;with no other meat but that,
      you would tell a very different tale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I acknowledge,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;that the body might fail, but not so the
      heart and will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;God has dealt very mercifully with you in
      leading you to have recourse to a quarter where you find such little
      contentment that you must needs console yourself with eating and drinking.
      Methinks in these matters you acquit yourself so well, that you should
      praise God for the tenderness of His cruelty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been so nurtured in torment,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;that I am beginning to
      be well pleased with woes of which other men complain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Longarine, &ldquo;our complaints debar you from company where
      your gladness makes you welcome; for nothing is so vexatious as an
      importunate lover.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, rather,&rdquo; answered Simontault, &ldquo;as a cruel lady &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I clearly see,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;now that the matter touches Simontault,
      that, if we stay until he brings his reasonings to an end, we shall find
      ourselves at complines (3) rather than vespers. Let us, therefore, go and
      praise God that this day has passed without graver dispute.&rdquo;
     </p>

</pre>
    <p>
      She was the first to rise, and all the others followed her, but Simontault
      and Longarine ceased not to carry on their quarrel, yet so gently that,
      without drawing of sword, Simontault won the victory, and proved that the
      strongest passion was the sorest need.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point they entered the church, where the monks were waiting for
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having heard vespers, they went to sup as much off words as meat, for
      their converse lasted as long as they were at table, and throughout the
      evening also, until Oisille told them that they might well retire and give
      some rest to their minds. The five days that were past had been filled
      with such brave stories, that she had great fear lest the sixth should not
      be equal to them; for, even if they were to invent their tales, it was not
      possible to tell any better than those true ones which had already been
      related in the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Geburon, however, told her that, so long as the world lasted, things would
      happen worthy of remembrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the wickedness of wicked men is always what it has been,
      as also is the goodness of the good. So long as wickedness and good reign
      upon earth, they will ever fill it with fresh actions, although it be
      written that there is nothing new under the sun. (4) But we, who have not
      been summoned to the intimate counsels of God, and who are ignorant of
      first causes, deem all new things noteworthy in proportion as we would not
      or could not ourselves accomplish them. So, be not afraid that the days to
      come will not be in keeping with those that are past, and be sure that on
      your own part you perform well your duty.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <p>
      Oisille replied that she commended herself to God, and in His name she
      bade them good-night.
    </p>
    <p>
      So all the company withdrew, thus bringing to an end the Fifth Day.

      A. (Tale XXXVI., Page 63.)
    </h2>
    <p>
      The following are the more important particulars, supplied by M. Jules
      Roman, with reference to President Charles of Grenoble:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeffroy Charles was an Italian, born in the marquisate of Saluzza, where
      his father, Constant, had been a distinguished jurisconsult. The hero of
      Queen Margaret&rsquo;s xxxvith tale always signed his name Jeffroy Charles, but
      his descendants adopted the spelling Carles. Doubtless the name had
      originally been Caroli. Before fixing himself in France, Jeffroy Charles
      had been in the service of Luigi II., Marquis of Saluzza, who had
      appointed him to the office of &ldquo;Podesta&rdquo; and entrusted him with various
      diplomatic missions to the French Court (see <i>Discorsi sopre alame
      famiglie nobili del Piemonte</i> by Francesco Agostini della Chiesa, in
      MS. in the State Archives, at Turin). At the time when Charles VIII. was
      planning his expedition to Naples, he gave a cordial greeting to all the
      Italians who presented themselves at his Court, and, securing the services
      of Jeffroy Charles, he appointed him counsellor of the Parliament of
      Grenoble (October 5, 1493), and entrusted him with various secret
      missions, the result being that he sojourned but unfrequently in Dauphiné.
      On the death of Charles VIII., Jeffroy secured the good graces of his
      successor, Louis XII., and was appointed (June 16, 1500) President of the
      Senate of Turin, and some months later Chief President of the Parliament
      of Grenoble. Charles spent the greater part of that year on missions, both
      to the Court of the Emperor Maximilian and that of the Pope. It was he who
      obtained from the former the investiture of Louis XII. as Duke of Milan,
      which afterwards led to so much warfare. Most of the following years he
      spent at Milan, seeking to organise the government of the duchy, and
      contending against the rapacity of both the French and the Italian nobles.
      In 1508 he was sent by Louis XII. to Cambrai, in company with Cardinal
      d&rsquo;Amboise, to conclude an alliance with the Emperor against Venice, and he
      also repaired the same year to Rome with Marshal Trivulzio to negotiate
      the Pope&rsquo;s entry into this league.
    </p>
    <p>
      On war being declared, he set aside his judicial robes, and took an active
      part in the campaign against Venice, fighting so bravely at Agnadel that
      Louis XII. knighted him on the battlefield. His last diplomatic mission
      was to the Court of Leo X. in 1515, in which year he was, on account of
      his great learning, appointed to direct the education of the King&rsquo;s
      younger daughter, the celebrated Renée of Ferrara. But it is doubtful
      whether he ever even entered upon these duties, since he died soon after
      he had been entrusted with them. His family remained in Dauphiné, where it
      died out, obscurely, during the seventeenth century. Only one of his sons,
      Anthony, evinced any talent, becoming counsellor of the Rouen Parliament
      (1519), and ambassador at Milan (1530). Lancelot de Carles, Bishop of
      Riez, was not, as some biographers assert, a son of Jeffroy Charles, nor
      was he, it would seem, in any way connected with the Saluzza family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeffroy Charles&rsquo;s wife, Margaret du Mottet, had borne him eight children
      before he surprised her in adultery. After the tragical ending of his
      conjugal mishaps he adopted as his crest the figure of an angel holding
      the forefinger of one hand to his mouth as if to enjoin secrecy. (1) In
      the seventeenth century this &ldquo;angel of silence&rdquo; was to be seen, carved in
      stone, and serving as a support of the Charles escutcheon, on the house
      where the President had resided in the Rue des Clercs at Grenoble (Guy
      Allard&rsquo;s <i>Dictionnaire du Dauphiné, &amp;c</i>, Grenoble 1695).
      Escutcheon and support have nowadays disappeared, but on certain of
      Charles&rsquo;s seals, as well as in books that belonged to him, now in the
      Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris, the emblem of the angel will still be
      found. The earliest seal on which we find it is one affixed to a receipt
      dated from Milan, July 31, 1506. Assuming that he adopted this crest in
      memory of the events narrated by Queen Margaret, it is probable that the
      latter occurred in the earlier part of 1506 or the latter part of the
      previous year. (2)

     1 The suggestion here presents itself that, apart from the
     question of any crime, this emblem of secrecy was a very
     fitting one for a diplomatist to assume.&mdash;Ed.

     2  That is, twenty years after the <i>Cent Nouvelles
     Nouvelles</i>, from which some commentators think the
     <i>Heptameron</i> story to have been borrowed, was first printed.

      Three copies of a medal showing Charles&rsquo;s energetic, angular profile, with
      the inscription <i>Jafredus Karoli jurisconsultus preses Delphinatus et
      Mediolani</i>, are known to exist; one in the Grenoble museum, one in that
      of Milan, and one in my (M. Roman&rsquo;s) collection. Three MS. works from the
      President&rsquo;s library are in the Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris. The
      frontispiece of one of these (MSS. Lat. No. 4801) is a miniature painting
      of his escutcheon, surmounted by the half-length figure of the &ldquo;angel of
      silence,&rdquo; who is clad in dark blue, with wings of red, green and blue
      feathers. On folio 74 of the same MS. is a full-length figure of the
      angel, clad in light blue and supporting Charles&rsquo;s escutcheon with one
      hand, whilst the forefinger of the other is pressed to his lips. In the
      libraries of Lyons, Grenoble and Turin are other richly-illuminated works
      that belonged to the President, who was a distinguished bibliophilist and
      great patron of letters, several learned Italian writers, and among
      others, J. P. Parisio, J. M. Cattaneo and P&rsquo;ranchino Gafforio, having
      dedicated their principal works to him. He it was, moreover, who saved the
      life of Aldo Manuzio, the famous Venetian printer, when he was arrested by
      the French as a spy in 1506.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     From the foregoing particulars it will be seen that
     President Charles was alike learned, brave and skilful. But
     for the Queen of Navarre&rsquo;s circumstantial narrative it would
     be hard to believe that a man with so creditable a public
     record killed his wife by means of a salad of poisonous
     herbs.&mdash;Ed.

      PROLOGUE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the morning the Lady Oisille went earlier than was her wont to make
      ready for her reading in the hall, but the company being advised of this,
      and eager to hearken to her excellent instruction, used such despatch in
      dressing themselves that she had not long to wait. Perceiving their
      fervour, she set about reading them the Epistle of St. John the
      Evangelist, which is full of naught but love, in the same wise as, on the
      foregoing days, she had expounded to them St. Paul&rsquo;s Epistle to the
      Romans. The company found this fare so much to their taste, that, although
      they tarried a half-hour longer than on the other days, it seemed to them
      as if they had not remained there a quarter of an hour altogether. From
      thence they proceeded to the contemplation of the mass, when one and all
      commended themselves to the Holy Ghost in order that they might that day
      be enabled to satisfy their merry audience; and, after they had broken
      their fast and taken a little rest, they set out to resume their
      accustomed diversion.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the Lady Oisille asking who should begin the day, Longarine made
      answer&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I give my vote to Madame Oisille; she has this day read to us so
      beauteous a lesson, that she can but tell us some story apt to crown the
      glory which she won this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;that I cannot tell you aught so profitable
      this afternoon as I did in the morning. But at least the purport of my
      story shall not depart from the teaching of Holy Scripture, where it is
      written, &lsquo;Trust not in princes, nor in the sons of men, in whom is not our
      salvation.&rsquo; (1) And that this truth may not be forgotten by you for lack
      of an example, I will tell you a tale which is quite true, and the memory
      of which is so fresh that the eyes of those that saw the piteous sight are
      scarcely yet dried.&rdquo;

      <i>TALE LI</i>.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>Because he would not have his son make a poor marriage, the
     Duke of Urbino, contrary to the promise given to his wife,
     hanged a young maiden by whom his son was wont to inform his
     sweetheart of the love he bore her</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      The Duke of Urbino, called the Prefect, (1) the same that married the
      sister of the first Duke of Mantua, had a son of between eighteen and
      twenty years of age, who was in love with a girl of an excellent and
      honourable house, sister to the Abbot of Farse. (2) And since, according
      to the custom of the country, he was not free to converse with her as he
      wished, he obtained the aid of a gentleman in his service, who was in love
      with a very beautiful and virtuous young damsel in the service of his
      mother. By means of this damsel he informed his sweetheart of the deep
      affection that he bore her; and the poor girl, thinking no harm, took
      pleasure in doing him service, believing his purpose to be so good and
      virtuous that she might honourably be the carrier of his intentions. But
      the Duke, who had more regard for the profit of his house than for any
      virtuous affection, was in such great fear lest these dealings should lead
      his son (3) into marriage, that he caused a strict watch to be kept;
      whereupon he was informed that the poor damsel had been concerned in
      carrying some letters from his son to the lady he loved. On hearing this
      he was in great wrath, and resolved to take the matter in hand.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  This is Francesco Maria I., della Rovere, nephew to Pope
     Julius II., by whom he was created Prefect of Rome. Brought
     up at the French Court, he became one of the great captains
     of the period, especially distinguishing himself in the
     command of the Venetian forces during the earlier part of
     his career. He married Leonora Ypolita Gonzaga, daughter of
     Francesco II., fourth Marquis of Mantua, respecting whom see
     <i>ante</i>, vol. iii., notes to Tale XIX. It was Leonora rather
     than her husband who imparted lustre to the Court of Urbino
     at this period by encouraging arts and letters. Among those
     who flourished there were Raffaelle and Baldassare
     Castiglione. Francesco Maria, born in March 1491, died in
     1538 from the effects&mdash;so it is asserted by several
     contemporary writers&mdash;of a poisonous lotion which a Mantuan
     barber had dropped into his ear. His wife, who bore him two
     sons (see post, note 3), died at the age of 72, in 1570.&mdash;L.
     and Ed.

     2  The French words are <i>Abbé de Farse</i>. Farse would appear
     to be a locality, as abbots were then usually designated by
     the names of their monasteries; still it may be intended for
     the Abbot&rsquo;s surname, and some commentators, adopting this
     view, have suggested that the proper reading would be
     Farnese.&mdash;Ed.

     3  The Duke&rsquo;s two sons were Federigo, born in March 1511,
     and Guidobaldo, born in April 1514. The former according to
     all authorities died when &ldquo;young,&rdquo; and probably long before
     reaching man&rsquo;s estate. Dennistoun, in his searching <i>Memoirs
     of the Dukes of Urbino</i> (London, 1851), clearly shows that
     for many years prior to Francesco Maria&rsquo;s death his second
     son Guidobaldo was the only child remaining to him. Already
     in 1534, when but twenty years old, Guidobaldo was regarded
     as his father&rsquo;s sole heir and successor. In that year
     Francesco Maria forced the young man to marry Giulia Varana,
     a child of eleven, in order that he might lay claim to her
     father&rsquo;s state of Camerino and annex it to the duchy. There
     is no record of Guidobaldo having ever engaged in any such
     intrigue as related by Queen Margaret in the above tale,
     still it must be to him that she refers, everything pointing
     to the conclusion that his brother Federigo died in
     childhood. Guidobaldo became Duke of Urbino on his father&rsquo;s
     death.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      He could not, however, conceal his anger so well that the maiden was not
      advised of it, and knowing his wickedness, which was in her eyes as great
      as his conscience was small, she felt a wondrous dread. Going therefore to
      the Duchess, she craved leave to retire somewhere out of the Duke&rsquo;s sight
      until his passion should be past; but her mistress replied that, before
      giving her leave to do so, she would try to find out her husband&rsquo;s will in
      the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very soon, however, the Duchess heard the Duke&rsquo;s evil words concerning the
      affair, and, knowing his temper, she not only gave the maiden leave, but
      advised her to retire into a convent until the storm was over. This she
      did as secretly as she could, yet not so stealthily but that the Duke was
      advised of it. Thereupon, with pretended cheerfulness of countenance, he
      asked his wife where the maiden was, and she, believing him to be well
      aware of the truth, confessed it to him. He feigned to be vexed thereat,
      saying that the girl had no need to behave in that fashion, and that for
      his part he desired her no harm. And he requested his wife to cause her to
      come back again, since it was by no means well to have such matters noised
      abroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duchess replied that, if the poor girl was so unfortunate as to have
      lost his favour, it were better for a time that she should not come into
      his presence; however, he would not hearken to her reasonings, but
      commanded her to bid the maiden return.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duchess failed not to make the Duke&rsquo;s will known to the maiden; but
      the latter, who could not but feel afraid, entreated her mistress that she
      might not be compelled to run this risk, saying that she knew the Duke was
      not so ready to forgive her as he feigned to be. Nevertheless, the Duchess
      assured her that she should take no hurt, and pledged her own life and
      honour for her safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl, who well knew that her mistress loved her, and would not lightly
      deceive her, trusted in her promise, believing that the Duke would never
      break a pledge when his wife&rsquo;s honour was its warranty. And accordingly
      she returned to the Duchess.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the Duke knew this, he failed not to repair to his wife&rsquo;s
      apartment. There, as soon as he saw the maiden, he said to his wife, &ldquo;So
      such-a-one has returned,&rdquo; and turning to his gentlemen, he commanded them
      to arrest her and lead her to prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this the poor Duchess, who by the pledging of her word had drawn the
      maiden from her refuge, was in such despair that, falling upon her knees
      before her husband, she prayed that for love of herself and of his house
      he would not do so foul a deed, seeing that it was in obedience to himself
      that she had drawn the maiden from her place of safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      But no prayer that she could utter availed to soften his hard heart, or to
      overcome his stern resolve to be avenged. Without making any reply, he
      withdrew as speedily as possible, and, foregoing all manner of trial, and
      forgetting God and the honour of his house, he cruelly caused the hapless
      maiden to be hanged.
    </p>
    <p>
      I cannot undertake to recount to you the grief of the Duchess; it was such
      as beseemed a lady of honour and a tender heart on beholding one, whom she
      would fain have saved, perish through trust in her own plighted faith.
      Still less is it possible to describe the deep affliction of the unhappy
      gentleman, the maiden&rsquo;s lover, who failed not to do all that in him lay to
      save his sweetheart&rsquo;s life, offering to give his own for hers; but no
      feeling of pity moved the heart of this Duke, whose only happiness was
      that of avenging himself on those whom he hated. (4)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     4  That Francesco-Maria was a man of a hasty, violent
     temperament is certain. Much that Guicciardini relates of
     him was doubtless penned in a spirit of resentment, for
     during the time the historian lived at Urbino the Duke
     repeatedly struck him, and on one occasion felled him to the
     ground, with the sneering remark, &ldquo;Your business is to
     confer with pedants.&rdquo; On the other hand, however, there is
     independent documentary evidence in existence&mdash;notably
     among the Urbino MSS. in the Vatican library&mdash;which shows
     that Francesco-Maria in no wise recoiled from shedding
     blood. He was yet in his teens when it was reported to him
     that his sister&mdash;the widow of Venanzio of Camerino, killed
     by Caesar Borgia&mdash;had secretly married a certain Giovanni
     Andrea of Verona and borne him a son. Watching his
     opportunity, Francesco-Maria set upon the unfortunate Andrea
     one day in the ducal chamber and then and there killed him,
     though not without resistance, for Andrea only succumbed
     after receiving <i>four-and-twenty</i> stabs with his murderer&rsquo;s
     poignard (Urbino MSS. Vat. No. 904). A few years later, in
     1511, Francesco-Maria assassinated the Papal Legate
     Alidosio, Cardinal Archbishop of Pavia, whom he encountered
     in the environs of Bologna riding his mule and followed by a
     hundred light horse. Nevertheless Urbino, with only a small
     retinue, galloped up to him, plunged a dagger into his
     stomach and fled before the soldiery could intervene. From
     these examples it will be seen that, although history has
     preserved no record of the affair related by Queen Margaret,
     her narrative may well be a true one.&mdash;Ed.

    <p>
      Thus, in spite of every law of honour, was the innocent maiden put to
      death by this cruel Duke, to the exceeding sorrow of all that knew her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See, ladies, what are the effects of wickedness when this is combined
      with power.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had indeed heard,&rdquo; said Longarine, &ldquo;that the Italians were prone to
      three especial vices; but I should not have thought that vengeance and
      cruelty would have gone so far as to deal a cruel death for so slight a
      cause.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Longarine,&rdquo; said Saffredent, laughing, &ldquo;you have told us one of the three
      vices, but we must also know the other two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you did not know them,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;I would inform you, but I am
      sure that you know them all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From your words,&rdquo; said Saffredent, &ldquo;it seems that you deem me very
      vicious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; said Longarine, &ldquo;but you so well know the ugliness of vice that,
      better than any other, you are able to avoid it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not be amazed,&rdquo; said Simontault, &ldquo;at this act of cruelty. Those who
      have passed through Italy have seen such incredible instances, that this
      one is in comparison but a trifling peccadillo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, truly,&rdquo; said Geburon. &ldquo;When Rivolta was taken by the French, (5)
      there was an Italian captain who was esteemed a knightly comrade, but on
      seeing the dead body of a man who was only his enemy in that being a
      Guelph he was opposed to the Ghibellines, he tore out his heart, broiled
      it on the coals and devoured it. And when some asked him how he liked it,
      he replied that he had never eaten so savoury or dainty a morsel. Not
      content with this fine deed, he killed the dead man&rsquo;s wife, and tearing
      out the fruit of her womb, dashed it against a wall. Then he filled the
      bodies both of husband and wife with oats and made his horses eat from
      them. Think you that such a man as that would not surely have put to death
      a girl whom he suspected of offending him?&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     5  Rivolta or Rivoli was captured by the French under Louis
     XII. in 1509. An instance of savagery identical in character
     with that mentioned by &ldquo;Geburon&rdquo; had already occurred at the
     time of Charles VIII.&lsquo;s expedition to Naples, when the
     culprit, a young Italian of good birth, was seized and
     publicly executed.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be acknowledged,&rdquo; said Ennasuite, &ldquo;that this Duke of Urbino was
      more afraid that his son might make a poor marriage than desirous of
      giving him a wife to his liking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you can have no doubt,&rdquo; replied Simon-tault, &ldquo;that it is the
      Italian nature to love unnaturally that which has been created only for
      nature&rsquo;s service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worse than that,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;they make a god of things that are
      contrary to nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there,&rdquo; said Longarine, &ldquo;you have another one of the sins that I
      meant; for we know that to love money, excepting so far as it be
      necessary, is idolatry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Parlamente then said that St. Paul had not forgotten the vices of the
      Italians, and of all those who believe that they exceed and surpass others
      in honour, prudence and human reason, and who trust so strongly to this
      last as to withhold from God the glory that is His due. Wherefore the
      Almighty, jealous of His honour, renders&rsquo; those who believe themselves
      possessed of more understanding than other men, more insensate even than
      wild the beasts, causing them to show by their unnatural deeds that their
      sense is reprobate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Longarine here interrupted Parlamente to say that this was indeed the
      third sin to which the Italians were prone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By my faith,&rdquo; said Nomerfide, &ldquo;this discourse is very pleasing to me,
      for, since those that possess the best trained and acutest understandings
      are punished by being made more witless even than wild beasts, it must
      follow that such as are humble, and low, and of little reach, like myself,
      are filled with the wisdom of angels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I protest to you,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;that I am not far from your opinion,
      for none is more ignorant than he who thinks he knows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never seen a mocker,&rdquo; said Geburon, &ldquo;that was not mocked, a
      deceiver that was not deceived, or a boaster that was not humbled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You remind me,&rdquo; said Simontault, &ldquo;of a deceit which, had it been of a
      seemly sort, I would willingly have related.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;since we are here to utter truth, I give you my
      vote that you may tell it to us whatsoever its nature may be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since you give place to me,&rdquo; said Simontault, &ldquo;I will tell it you.&rdquo;

      <i>TALE LII</i>.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>An apothecary s man, espying behind him an advocate who was
     to plague him, and on whom he desired to be revenged,
     dropped from his sleeve a lump of frozen ordure, wrapped in
     paper like a sugar-loaf, which a gentleman who was with the
     advocate picked up and hid in his bosom, and then went to
     breakfast at a tavern, whence he came forth with all the
     cost and shame that he had thought to bring upon the poor
     varlet</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      Near the town of Alençon there lived a gentleman called the Lord of La
      Tireliere, who one morning came from his house to the town afoot, both
      because the distance was not great and because it was freezing hard. (1)
      When he had done his business, he sought out a crony of his, an advocate
      named Anthony Bacheré, and, after speaking with him of his affairs, he
      told him that he should much like to meet with a good breakfast, but at
      somebody else&rsquo;s expense. While thus discussing, they sat themselves down
      in front of an apothecary&rsquo;s shop, where there was a varlet who listened to
      them, and who forthwith resolved to give them their breakfast.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  The phraseology of this story varies considerably in the
     different MSS. of the <i>Heptameron</i>. In No. 1520, for
     instance, the tale begins as follows: &ldquo;In the town of
     Alençon, in the time of the last Duke Charles, there was an
     advocate, a merry companion, fond of breakfasting o&rsquo;
     mornings. One day, whilst he sat at his door, he saw pass a
     gentleman called the Lord of La Tilleriere, who, by reason
     of the extreme cold, had come on foot from his house to the
     town in order to attend to certain business there, and in
     doing so had not forgotten to put on his great robe, lined
     with fox-skin. And when he saw the advocate, who was much
     such a man as himself, he told him that he had completed his
     business, and had nothing further to do, except it were to
     find a good breakfast. The advocate made answer that they
     could find breakfasts enough and to spare, provided they had
     some one to defray the cost, and, taking the other under the
     arm, he said to him, &lsquo;Come, gossip, we may perhaps find some
     fool who will pay the reckoning for us both.&rsquo; Now behind
     them was an apothecary&rsquo;s man, an artful and inventive
     fellow, whom this advocate was always plaguing,&rdquo; &amp;c.&mdash;L.
</pre>
    <p>
      He went out from his shop into a street whither all repaired on needful
      occasions, (2) and there found a large lump of ordure standing on end, and
      so well frozen that it looked like a small loaf of fine sugar. Forthwith
      he wrapped it in handsome white paper, in the manner he was wont to use
      for the attraction of customers, and hid it in his sleeve.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     2  In olden time, as shown in the <i>Mémoires de l&rsquo;Académie de
     Troyes</i>, there were in most French towns streets specially
     set aside for the purpose referred to. At Alençon, in Queen
     Margaret&rsquo;s time, there was a street called the Rue des
     Fumiers, as appears from a report dated March 8, 1564
     (Archives of the Orne, Series A). Probably it is to this
     street that she alludes. (Communicated by M. L. Duval,
     archivist of the department of the Orne).&mdash;M.
</pre>
    <p>
      Afterwards he came and passed in front of the gentleman and the advocate,
      and, letting the sugar-loaf (3) fall near them, as if by mischance, went
      into a house whither he had pretended to be carrying it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lord of La Tirelière (4) hastened back with all speed to pick up what
      he thought to be a sugar-loaf, and just as he had done so the apothecary&rsquo;s
      man also came back looking and asking for his sugar everywhere.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     3  M. Duval, archivist of the Orne, states that La
     Tirelière, which is situated near St. Germain-du-Corbois,
     within three miles of Alençon, is an old <i>gentilhommière</i> or
     manor-house, surrounded by a moat. It was originally a
     simple <i>vavassonrie</i> held in fief from the Counts and Dukes
     of Alençon by the Pantolf and Crouches families, and in the
     seventeenth century was merged into the marquisate of
     L&rsquo;Isle.&mdash;M.

     4  Sugar was at this period sold by apothecaries, and was a
     rare and costly luxury. There were loaves of various sizes,
     but none so large as those of the present time.&mdash;M.
</pre>
    <p>
      The gentleman, thinking that he had cleverly tricked him, then went in
      haste to a tavern with his crony, to whom he said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our breakfast has been paid for at the cost of that varlet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he was come to the tavern he called for good bread, good wine and
      good meat, for he thought that he had wherewith to pay. But whilst he was
      eating, as he began to grow warm, his sugar-loaf in its turn began to thaw
      and melt, and filled the whole room with the smell peculiar to it,
      whereupon he, who carried it in his bosom, grew wroth with the
      waiting-woman, and said to her&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are the filthiest folks that ever I knew in this town, for either you
      or your children have strewn all this room with filth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By St. Peter!&rdquo; replied the woman, &ldquo;there is no filth here unless you have
      brought it in yourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon they rose, by reason of the great stench that they smelt, and
      went up to the fire, where the gentleman drew out of his bosom a
      handkerchief all dyed with the melted sugar, and on opening his robe,
      lined with fox-skin, found it to be quite spoiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      And all that he was able to say to his crony was this&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The rogue whom we thought to deceive has deceived us instead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then they paid their reckoning and went away as vexed as they had been
      merry on their arrival, when they fancied they had tricked the
      apothecary&rsquo;s varlet. (5)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     5  In MS. 1520, this tale ends in the following manner:&mdash;
     &ldquo;They were no sooner in the street than they perceived the
     apothecary&rsquo;s man going about and making inquiry of every one
     whether they had not seen a loaf of sugar wrapped in paper.
     They [the advocate and his companion] sought to avoid him,
     but he called aloud to the advocate, &lsquo;If you have my loaf of
     sugar, sir, I beg that you will give it back to me, for &lsquo;tis
     a double sin to rob a poor servant.&rsquo; His shouts brought to
     the spot many people curious to witness the dispute, and the
     true circumstances of the case were so well proven, that the
     apothecary&rsquo;s man was as glad to have been robbed as the
     others were vexed at having committed such a nasty theft.
     However, they comforted themselves with the hope that they
     might some day give him tit for tat.&rdquo;&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Often, ladies, do we see the like befall those who delight in using such
      cunning. If the gentleman had not sought to eat at another&rsquo;s expense, he
      would not have drunk so vile a beverage at his own. It is true, ladies,
      that my story is not a very clean one, but you gave me license to speak
      the truth, and I have done so in order to show you that no one is sorry
      when a deceiver is deceived.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is commonly said,&rdquo; replied Hircan, &ldquo;that words have no stink, yet
      those for whom they are intended do not easily escape smelling them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;that such words do not stink, but there are
      others which are spoken of as nasty, and which are of such evil odour that
      they disgust the soul even more than the body is disgusted when it smells
      such a sugar-loaf as you described in the tale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pray you,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;tell me what words you know of so foul as to
      sicken both the heart and soul of a virtuous woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would indeed be seemly,&rdquo; replied Oisille, &ldquo;that I should tell you
      words which I counsel no woman to utter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By that,&rdquo; said Saffredent, &ldquo;I quite understand what those terms are. They
      are such as women desirous of being held discreet do not commonly employ.
      But I would ask all the ladies present why, when they dare not utter them,
      they are so ready to laugh at them when they are used in their presence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then said Parlamente&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We do not laugh because we hear such pretty expressions, though it is
      indeed true that every one is disposed to laugh on seeing anybody stumble
      or on hearing any one utter an unfitting word, as often happens. The
      tongue will trip and cause one word to be used for another, even by the
      discreetest and most excellent speakers. But when you men talk viciously,
      not from ignorance, but by reason of your own wickedness, I know of no
      virtuous woman who does not feel a loathing for such speakers, and who
      would not merely refuse to hearken to them, but even to remain in their
      company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is very true,&rdquo; responded Geburon. &ldquo;I have frequently seen women make
      the sign of the cross on hearing certain words spoken, and cease not in
      doing so after these words had been uttered a second time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how many times,&rdquo; said Simontault, &ldquo;have they put on their masks (6)
      in order to laugh as freely as they pretended to be angry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet it were better to do this,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;than to let it be seen
      that the talk pleased them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Dagoucin, &ldquo;you praise a lady&rsquo;s hypocrisy no less than her
      virtue?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Virtue would be far better,&rdquo; said Longarine, &ldquo;but, when it is lacking,
      recourse must be had to hypocrisy, just as we use our slippers (7) to
      disguise our littleness. And it is no small matter to be able to conceal
      our imperfections.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     8  <i>Tourets-de-nez</i>. <i>See ante</i>, vol. iii. p. 27, note 5.&mdash;Ed.

     7  High-heeled slippers or <i>mules</i> were then worn.&mdash;B. J.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By my word,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;it were better sometimes to show some slight
      imperfection than to cover it so closely with the cloak of virtue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; said Ennasuitc, &ldquo;that a borrowed garment brings the borrower
      as much dishonour when he is constrained to return it as it brought him
      honour whilst it was being worn, and there is a lady now living who, by
      being too eager to conceal a small error, fell into a greater.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;that I know whom you mean; in any case, however,
      do not pronounce her name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho! ho!&rdquo; said Geburon [to Ennasuite], &ldquo;I give you my vote on condition
      that when you have related the story you will tell us the names. We will
      swear never to mention them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promise it,&rdquo; said Knnasuite, &ldquo;for there is nothing that may not be told
      in all honour.&rdquo;

     <i>By her dissimulation the Lady of Neufchastel caused the
     Prince of Belhoste to put her to such proof that it turned
     to her dishonour</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      King Francis the First was once at a handsome and pleasant castle, whither
      he had gone with a small following, both for the purpose of hunting and in
      order to take some repose. With him in his train was a certain Prince of
      Belhoste, (1) as worshipful, virtuous, discreet and handsome a Prince as
      any at Court. The wife he had married did not belong to a family of high
      rank, yet he loved her as dearly and treated her as well as it were
      possible for a husband to do, and also trusted in her. And when he was in
      love with anybody he never concealed it from her, knowing that she had no
      other will than his own.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  The Bibliophile Jacob surmises that this personage may be
     one of the Italian grandees at that period in the service of
     France, in which case the allusion may be to John
     Caraccioli, Prince of Melphes, created a marshal of France
     in 1544. Queen Margaret, however, makes no mention of her
     Prince being a foreigner. &ldquo;Belhoste&rdquo; is of course a
     fictitious name invented to replace that which the Prince
     really bore, and admits of so many interpretations that its
     meaning in the present instance cannot well be determined.
     From the circumstance, however, that the Prince&rsquo;s wife was
     of inferior birth to himself, it is not impossible that the
     personage referred to may be either Charles de Bourbon,
     Prince of La Roche-sur-Yonne and Duke of Beaupréau, or John
     VIII., Lord of Créqui, Canaples and Pontdormi, and Prince of
     Poix. The former, who married Philippa de Montespedon, widow
     of René de Montéjan, and a lady of honour to Catherine de&rsquo;
     Medici when Dauphiness, took a prominent part in the last
     wars of Francis I.&lsquo;s reign, and survived till 1565. The
     latter, generally known at Court by the name of Canaples,
     was a gentleman of the chamber and an especial favourite of
     Francis I. Brantôme says of him in his <i>Homines Illustres</i>
     that he was &ldquo;a valiant lord and the strongest man of arms
     that in those days existed in all Christendom, for he broke
     a lance, no matter its strength, as easily as though it were
     a mere switch, and few were able to withstand him.&rdquo; In 1525
     the Prince of Poix married a Demoiselle d&rsquo;Acigné or Assigny,
     of <i>petite noblesse</i>, who in 1532 became a lady of honour to
     Queen Eleanor. She died in 1558, surviving her husband by
     three years. See Rouard&rsquo;s rare <i>Notice dun Recueil de
     Crayons à la Bibliothèque Méjanes d&rsquo;Aix</i>, Paris, 1863.&mdash;Ed.

    <p>
      Now this Prince conceived a deep affection for a widow lady called Madame
      de Neufchastel, (2) who was reputed the most beautiful woman it were
      possible to see; and if the Prince of Bel-hoste loved her well, his wife
      loved her no less, and would often send and bid her to dinner, for she
      deemed her so discreet and honourable, that, instead of being grieved by
      her husband&rsquo;s love for her, she rejoiced to see him address his attentions
      to one so full of honour and virtue.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     2  M. Lacroix thinks that this lady may be Jane de Hochberg,
     only daughter of Philip, sovereign Count of Neufchâtel.
     According to the custom of the time, she was commonly called
     Madame de Neufchâtel, despite her marriage with Louis
     d&rsquo;Orléans, Duke of Longueville. She died in 1543, after a
     lengthy widowhood. We consider the accuracy of M. Lacroix&rsquo;s
     surmise to be extremely doubtful, for the names of both the
     men figuring in the story are obviously altered so as to
     conceal their identity, and it is therefore not likely that
     Queen Margaret would designate the lady by her real name,
     and thus publish her shame to the world. The Madame de
     Neufchâtel she speaks of may really have been a Madame de
     Châteauneuf, Châteauvieux or Maisonneuve; or we may again be
     in presence of Margaret&rsquo;s lady of honour, the widowed
     Blanche de Chastillon, <i>née</i> de Tournon, to whom frequent
     reference has been made.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      This affection lasted for a great while, the Prince of Belhoste caring for
      all the lady&rsquo;s affairs as though they were his own, and his wife doing no
      less. By reason, however, of her beauty many great lords and gentlemen
      earnestly sought the lady&rsquo;s favour, some only for love&rsquo;s sake, others for
      sake of the ring, for, besides being beautiful, she was also very rich.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the rest was a young gentleman, called the Lord des Cheriots, (3)
      who wooed her so ardently that he was never absent from her levee and
      couchée, and was also with her as much as possible during the day. This
      did not please the Prince of Belhoste, who thought that a man of such poor
      estate, and so lacking in grace, did not deserve an honourable and
      gracious reception, and he often made remonstrances about it to the lady.
      She, however, being one of Eve&rsquo;s daughters, (4) excused herself by saying
      that she spoke with every one in general, and that their own affection was
      the better concealed, since she never spoke more with one than with
      another.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     3  &ldquo;Des Cheriots&rdquo; (occasionally Des Cheriotz in the MS.) may
     be a play upon the name of D&rsquo;Escars, sometimes written Des
     Cars. According to La Curne de Ste. Palaye <i>car</i> as well as
     <i>char</i> signified chariot. The D&rsquo;Escars dukedom is modern,
     dating from 1815, and in the time of Francis I. the family
     was of small estate. Some members of it may well have filled
     inferior offices about the court, as in 1536 a Demoiselle
     Suzanne d&rsquo;Escars married Geoffrey de Pompadour, who was both
     a prothonotary and cupbearer to Francis I., and lived to
     become Governor of the Limousin under Charles IX.&mdash;M. and
     Ed.

     4  We take this expression from MS. 1520. Ours says, &ldquo;a
     daughter of the Duke,&rdquo; which is evidently an error.&mdash;L.
</pre>
    <p>
      Albeit, after some time, this Lord des Cheriots so pressed her that, more
      through his importunity than through love, she promised to marry him,
      begging him, however, not to urge her to reveal the marriage until her
      daughters were wedded. After this the gentleman was wont to go with
      untroubled conscience to her chamber at whatsoever hour he chose, and none
      but a waiting-woman and a serving-man had knowledge of the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Prince perceived that the gentleman was growing more and more
      familiar in the house of her whom he so dearly loved, he took it in
      ill-part, and could not refrain from saying to the lady&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have always prized your honour like that of my own sister, and you are
      aware of the honourable manner in which I have addressed you, and the
      happiness that I have in loving a lady as discreet and virtuous as
      yourself; but did I think that another who deserves it not could win by
      importunity that which I am not willing to crave, contrary to your own
      desire, this would be unendurable to me, and in the like degree
      dishonouring to you. I tell you this because you are beautiful and young,
      and although hitherto of good repute, are now beginning to gain a very
      evil fame. Even though he be not your equal in birth or fortune, and have
      less influence, knowledge and address, yet it were better to have married
      him than to give all men matter for suspicion. I pray you, therefore, tell
      me whether you are resolved to love him, for I will not have him as fellow
      of mine. I would rather leave you altogether to him, and put away from me
      the feelings that I have hitherto borne you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The poor lady, fearful of losing his affection, thereupon began to weep,
      and vowed to him that she would rather die than wed the gentleman of whom
      he had spoken, but (she added) he was so importunate that she could not
      help his entering her chamber at a time when every one else did so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of such times as those,&rdquo; said the Prince, &ldquo;I do not speak, for I can go
      as well as he, and see all what you are doing. But I have been told that
      he goes after you are in bed, and this I look upon as so extraordinary
      that, if you should continue in this mode of life without declaring him to
      be your husband, you will be disgraced more than any woman that ever
      lived.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She swore to him with all the oaths she could utter that the other was
      neither her husband nor her lover, but only as importunate a gentleman as
      there well could be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since he is troublesome to you,&rdquo; said the Prince, &ldquo;I promise you that I
      will rid you of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; asked the lady. &ldquo;Would you kill him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said the Prince, &ldquo;but I will give him to understood that it is
      not in such a place as this, not in such a house as the King&rsquo;s, that
      ladies are to be put to shame. And I swear to you by the faith of the
      lover that I am, that if, after I have spoken with him, he does not
      correct himself, I will correct him in such a manner as to make him a
      warning to others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying he went away, and on leaving the room failed not to meet the
      Lord des Cheriots on his way in. To him he spoke after the fashion that
      you have heard, assuring him that the first time he was found there after
      an hour at which gentlemen might reasonably visit the ladies, he would
      give him such a fright as he would ever remember. And he added that the
      lady was of too noble a house to be trifled with after such a fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman protested that he had never been in the room except in the
      same manner as the rest, and, if the Prince should find him there, he gave
      him full leave to do his worst.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day afterwards, when the gentleman believed the Prince&rsquo;s words to have
      been forgotten, he went to see his lady in the evening, and remained
      sufficiently late.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince [that same evening] told his wife that Madame de Neufchastel
      had a severe cold, upon hearing which the worthy lady begged that he would
      visit her on behalf of them both, and make excuse for herself, since she
      could not go by reason of a certain matter that she must needs attend to
      in her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince waited until the King was in bed, and then went to give the
      lady good-evening, but as he was going up a stairway he met a serving-man
      coming down, who, on being asked how his mistress did, swore that she was
      in bed and asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince went down the stairway, but, suspecting that the servant had
      lied, looked behind and saw him going back again with all speed. He walked
      about the courtyard in front of the door to see whether the servant would
      return. A quarter of an hour later he perceived him come down again and
      look all about to see who was in the courtyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Forthwith the Prince was convinced that the Lord des Cheriots was in the
      lady&rsquo;s chamber, but through fear of himself durst not come down, and he
      therefore again walked about for a long-while.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, observing that the lady&rsquo;s room had a casement which was not at
      all high up, and which looked upon a little garden, he remembered the
      proverb which says, &ldquo;When the door fails the window avails,&rdquo; and he
      thereupon called a servant of his own, and said to him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go into the garden there behind, and, if you see a gentleman come down
      from the window, draw your sword as soon as he reaches the ground, clash
      it against the wall, and cry out, &lsquo;Slay! slay!&rsquo; Be careful, however, that
      you do not touch him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The servant went whither his master had sent him, and the Prince walked
      about until three hours after midnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Lord des Cheriots heard that the Prince was still in the yard, he
      resolved to descend by the window, and, having first thrown clown his
      cloak, he then, by the help of his good friends, leapt into the garden. As
      soon as the servant saw him, he failed not to make a noise with his sword,
      at the same time crying, &ldquo;Slay! slay!&rdquo; Upon this the poor gentleman,
      believing it was his [the servant&rsquo;s] master, was in such great fear that,
      without thinking of his cloak, he fled as quickly as he was able.
    </p>
    <p>
      He met the archers of the watch, who wondered greatly to see him running
      in this fashion, but he durst say nothing to them, except to beg them to
      open him the gate [of the castle], or else to lodge him with themselves
      until morning. And this, as they had not the keys, they did.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the Prince went to bed, and, finding his wife asleep, awoke her
      saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess, my wife, what hour it is.&lsquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not heard the clock strike since I went to bed,&rdquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is three hours after midnight,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that be so,&rdquo; said his wife, &ldquo;where have you been all this time? I
      greatly fear that your health will be the worse for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sweetheart,&rdquo; said the Prince, &ldquo;watching will never make me ill when I am
      engaged in preventing those who try to deceive me from going to sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he began to laugh so heartily that his wife begged him to tell
      her of the matter. This he did at length, showing her the wolf&rsquo;s skin (4)
      which his servant had brought him. After making merry at the expense of
      the hapless lovers, they went to sleep in gentle tranquillity, while the
      other two passed the night in torment, fearing and dreading lest the
      affair should be revealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the gentleman, knowing right well that he could not use
      concealment with the Prince, came to him in the morning when he was
      dressing to beg that he would not expose him, and would give orders for
      the return of his cloak.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince pretended that he knew nothing of the matter, and put such a
      face on it that the gentleman was wholly at a loss what to think. But in
      the end he received a rating that he had not expected, for the Prince
      assured him that, if ever he went to the lady&rsquo;s room again, he would tell
      the King of it, and have him banished the Court.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pray you, ladies, judge whether it had not been better for this poor
      lady to have spoken freely to him who did her the honour of loving and
      esteeming her, instead of leading him by her dissimulation to prove her in
      a way that brought her so much shame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She knew,&rdquo; said Geburon, &ldquo;that if she confessed the truth she would
      wholly lose his favour, and this she on no account desired to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; said Longarine, &ldquo;that when she had chosen a husband to
      her liking, she ought not to have feared the loss of any other man&rsquo;s
      affection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;that if she had dared to reveal her
      marriage, she would have been quite content with her husband; but she
      wished to hide it until her daughters were wed, and so she would not
      abandon so good a means of concealment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was not for that reason,&rdquo; said Saffredent, &ldquo;but because the ambition
      of women is so great that they are never satisfied with having only one
      lover. I have heard that the discreetest of them are glad to have three&mdash;one,
      namely, for honour, one for profit, and one for delight. Each of the three
      thinks himself loved the best, but the first two are as servants to the
      last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;of such women as have neither love nor
      honour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said Saffredent, &ldquo;there are some of the kind that I describe,
      whom you reckon among the most honourable in the land.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may be sure,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;that a crafty woman will be able to live
      where all others die of hunger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And,&rdquo; said Longarine, &ldquo;when their craftiness is discerned, &lsquo;tis death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, &lsquo;tis life,&rdquo; said Simontault, &ldquo;for they deem it no small glory to be
      reputed more crafty than their fellows. And the reputation of &lsquo;crafty,&rsquo;
      gained thus at their own expense, brings lovers more readily under
      subjection to them than does their beauty, for one of the greatest
      delights shared by those who are in love is to conduct the affair slyly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak,&rdquo; said Ennasuite, &ldquo;of wanton love, for the honourable has no
      need of concealment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Dagoucin, &ldquo;I pray you put that thought out of your head. The
      more precious the drug, the less should it be exposed to the air, because
      of the perverseness of those who trust only to outward signs. These are
      not different in the case of honourable and faithful affection than in any
      other case, so they must none the less be hidden when the love is virtuous
      than when it is the opposite, if one would avoid the evil opinion of those
      who cannot believe that a man may love a lady in all honour, and who,
      being themselves slaves to pleasure, think every one else the same. If we
      were all of good faith, look and speech would be without concealment, at
      least toward those who would rather die than take them in an evil sense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I protest to you, Dagoucin,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;that your philosophy is too
      deep for any man here to understand or believe. You would have us think
      that men are angels, or stones, or devils.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am well aware,&rdquo; said Dagoucin, &ldquo;that men are men and subject to every
      passion, but there are some, nevertheless, who would rather die than that
      their mistresses should, for their delight, do aught against their
      consciences.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To die means a great deal,&rdquo; said Geburon. &ldquo;I would not believe that of
      them were it uttered by the lips of the austerest monk alive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, I believe,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;that there is none but desires the very
      opposite. But they make pretence of disliking the grapes when these hang
      too high to be gathered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still,&rdquo; said Nomcrfide, &ldquo;I am sure that the Prince&rsquo;s wife was very glad
      to find that her husband was learning to know women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you it was not so,&rdquo; said Ennasuite. &ldquo;She was very sorry on
      account of the love that she bore the lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would as soon,&rdquo; said Saffredent, &ldquo;have the lady who laughed when her
      husband kissed her maid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In sooth,&rdquo; said Ennasuite, &ldquo;you shall tell us the story. I give place to
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Although the story is very short,&rdquo; said Saffredent, &ldquo;I will still relate
      it, for I would rather make you laugh than speak myself at length.&rdquo;

      <i>TALE LIV</i>.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>Thogas&rsquo;s wife, believing that her husband loved none but
     herself, was pleased that her serving-woman should amuse
     him, and laughed when in her presence he kissed the girl
     before her eyes, and with her knowledge</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      Between the Pyrenees Mountains and the Alps, there dwelt a gentleman named
      Thogas, (1) who had a wife and children, with a very beautiful house, and
      so much wealth and pleasure at his hand, that there was reason he should
      live in contentment, had it not been that he was subject to great pain
      beneath the roots of the hair, in such wise that the doctors advised him
      to sleep no longer with his wife. She, whose chief thought was for her
      husband&rsquo;s life and health, readily consented, and caused her bed to be set
      in another corner of the room directly opposite her husband&rsquo;s, so that
      they could neither of them put out their heads without seeing each other.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  We are unable to trace any family named Thogas, which is
     probably a fictitious appellation. Read backwards with the
     letter h omitted it forms Sagot, whilst if the syllables be
     transposed it suggests Guasto, a well-known Basque or
     Navarrese name.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      This lady had two serving-women, and often when the lord and his lady were
      in bed, they would each take some diverting book to read, whilst the
      serving-women held candles, the younger, that is, for the gentleman, and
      the other for his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman, finding that the maid was younger and handsomer than her
      mistress, took such great pleasure in observing her that he would break
      off his reading in order to converse with her. His wife could hear this
      very plainly, but believing that her husband loved none but herself, she
      was well pleased that her servants should amuse him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened one evening, however, when they had read longer than was their
      wont, that the lady looked towards her husband&rsquo;s bed where was the young
      serving-maid holding the candle. Of her she could see nothing but her
      back, and of her husband nothing at all excepting on the side of the
      chimney, which jutted out in front of his bed, and the white wall of which
      was bright with the light from the candle. And upon this wall she could
      plainly see the shadows both of her husband and of her maid; whether they
      drew apart, or came near together or laughed, it was all as clear to her
      as though she had veritably beheld them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman, using no precaution since he felt sure that his wife could
      not see them, kissed her maid, and on the first occasion his wife suffered
      this to pass without uttering a word. But when she saw that the shadows
      frequently returned to this fellowship, she feared that there might be
      some reality beneath it all, and burst into a loud laugh, whereat the
      shadows were alarmed and separated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman then asked his wife why she was laughing so heartily, so
      that he might have a share in her merriment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Husband,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;I am so foolish that I laugh at my own shadow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Inquire as he might, she would never acknowledge any other reason, but,
      nevertheless, he thenceforward refrained from kissing such shadow-faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the story of which I was reminded when I spoke of the lady who
      loved her husband&rsquo;s sweetheart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By my faith,&rdquo; said Ennasuite, &ldquo;if my maid had treated me in that fashion,
      I should have risen and extinguished the candle upon her nose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are indeed terrible,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;but it had been well done if your
      husband and the maid had both turned upon you and beaten you soundly.
      There should not be so much ado for a kiss; and &lsquo;twould have been better
      if his wife had said nothing about it, and had suffered him to take his
      pastime, which might perchance have cured his complaint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;she was afraid that the end of the pastime would
      make him worse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was not one of those,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;against whom our Lord says, &lsquo;We
      have mourned to you and ye have not lamented, we have sung to you and ye
      have not danced,&rsquo; (2) for when her husband was ill, she wept, and when he
      was merry, she laughed. In the same fashion every virtuous woman ought to
      share the good and evil, the joy and the sadness of her husband, and serve
      and obey him as the Church does Jesus Christ.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     2  &ldquo;They are like unto children sitting in the market-place,
     and calling one to another, and saying, We have piped unto
     you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye
     have not wept.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>St. Luke</i> vii. 32.&mdash;M.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, ladies,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;our husbands should be to us what Christ
      is to the Church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So are we,&rdquo; said Saffredent, &ldquo;and, if it were possible, something more;
      for Christ died but once for His Church, whereas we die daily for our
      wives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Die!&rdquo; said Longarine. &ldquo;Methinks that you and the others here present are
      now worth more crowns than you were worth pence before you were wed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I know why,&rdquo; said Saffredent; &ldquo;it is because our worth is often
      tried. Still our shoulders are sensible of having worn the cuirass so
      long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If,&rdquo; said Ennasuite, &ldquo;you had been obliged to wear harness for a month
      and lie on the hard ground, you would greatly long to regain the bed of
      your excellent wife, and wear the cuirass of which you now complain. But
      it is said that everything can be endured except ease, and that none know
      what rest is until they have lost it. This foolish woman, who laughed when
      her husband was merry, was fond of taking her rest under any
      circumstances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure,&rdquo; said Longarine, &ldquo;that she loved her rest better than her
      husband, since she took nothing that he did to heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She did take to heart,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;those things which might have
      been hurtful to his conscience and his health, but she would not dwell
      upon trifles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you speak of conscience,&rdquo; said Simontault &ldquo;you make me laugh. &lsquo;Tis a
      thing to which I would have no woman give heed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be a good thing,&rdquo; said Nomerfide, &ldquo;if you had a wife like one
      who, after her husband&rsquo;s death, proved that she loved her money better
      than her conscience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pray you,&rdquo; said Saffredent, &ldquo;tell us that tale. I give you my vote.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had not intended,&rdquo; said Nomcrfide, &ldquo;to relate so short a story, but,
      since it is suited to the occasion, I will do so.&rdquo;

      <i>TALE LV</i>.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>A merchant&rsquo;s widow, whilst carrying out her husband&rsquo;s will,
     interpreted its purport to the advantage of herself and her
     children</i>. (1)
</pre>
    <p>
      In the town of Safagossa there lived a rich merchant, who, finding his
      death draw nigh, and himself no longer able to retain possession of his
      goods&mdash;-which he had perchance gathered together by evil means&mdash;thought
      that if he made a little present to God, he might thus after his death
      make part atonement for his sins, just as though God sold His pardon for
      money. Accordingly, when he had settled matters in respect of his house,
      he declared it to be his desire that a fine Spanish horse which he
      possessed should be sold for as much as it would bring, and the money
      obtained for it be distributed among the poor. And he begged his wife that
      she would in no wise fail to sell the horse as soon as he was dead, and
      distribute the money in the manner he had commanded.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  Whether the incidents here related be true or not, it is
     probable that this was a story told to Queen Margaret at the
     time of her journey to Spain in 1525. It will have been
     observed (<i>ante</i>, pp. 36 and 42) that both the previous tale
     and this one are introduced into the <i>Heptameron</i> in a semi-
     apologetic fashion, as though the Queen had not originally
     intended that her work should include such short, slight
     anecdotes. However, already at this stage&mdash;the fifty-fifth
     only of the hundred tales which she proposed writing&mdash;she
     probably found fewer materials at her disposal than she had
     anticipated, and harked back to incidents of her earlier
     years, which she had at first thought too trifling to
     record. Still, slight as this story may be, it is not
     without point. The example set by the wife of the Saragossa
     merchant has been followed in modern times in more ways than
     one.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      When the burial was over and the first tears were shed, the wife, who was
      no more of a fool than Spanish women are used to be, went to the servant
      who with herself had heard his master declare his desire, and said to him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Methinks I have lost enough in the person of a husband I loved so dearly,
      without afterwards losing his possessions. Yet would I not disobey his
      word, but rather better his intention; for the poor man, led astray by the
      greed of the priests, thought to make a great sacrifice to God in
      bestowing after his death a sum of money, not a crown of which, as you
      well know, he would have given in his lifetime to relieve even the sorest
      need. I have therefore bethought me that we will do what he commanded at
      his death, and in still better fashion than he himself would have done if
      had he lived a fortnight longer. But no living person must know aught of
      the matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When she had received the servant&rsquo;s promise to keep it secret, she said to
      him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will go and sell the horse, and when you are asked, &lsquo;How much?&rsquo; you
      will reply, &lsquo;A ducat.&rsquo; I have, however, a very fine cat which I also wish
      to dispose of, and you will sell it with the horse for ninety-nine ducats,
      so that cat and horse together will bring in the hundred ducats for which
      my husband wished to sell the horse alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The servant readily fulfilled his mistress&rsquo;s command. While he was walking
      the horse about the market-place, and holding the cat in his arms, a
      gentleman, who had seen the horse before, and was desirous of possessing
      it, asked the servant what price he sought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A ducat,&rdquo; replied the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pray you,&rdquo; said the gentleman, &ldquo;do not mock me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you, sir,&rdquo; said the servant, &ldquo;that it will cost you only a
      ducat. It is true that the cat must be bought at the same time, and for
      the cat I must have nine and ninety ducats.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Forthwith, the gentleman, thinking the bargain a reasonable one, paid him
      one ducat for the horse, and the remainder as was desired of him, and took
      his goods away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant, on his part, went off with the money, with which his mistress
      was right well pleased, and she failed not to give the ducat that the
      horse had brought to the poor Mendicants, (2) as her husband had
      commanded, and the remainder she kept for the needs of herself and her
      children. (3)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     2  The allusion is not to the ordinary beggars who then, as
     now, swarmed in Spain, but to the Mendicant friars.&mdash;Ed.

     3  In Boaistuau&rsquo;s and Gruget&rsquo;s editions of the <i>Heptameron</i>
     the dialogue following this tale is replaced by matter of
     their own invention. They did not dare to reproduce Queen
     Margaret&rsquo;s bold opinions respecting the clergy, the monastic
     orders, &amp;c., at a time when scores of people, including even
     Counsellors of Parliament, were being burnt at the stake for
     heresy.&mdash;L. and Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What think you? Was she not far more prudent than her husband, and did
      she not think less of her conscience than of the advantage of her
      household?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;that she did love her husband; but, seeing
      that most men wander in their wits when at the point of death, and knowing
      his intentions, she tried to interpret them to her children&rsquo;s advantage.
      And therein I hold her to have been very prudent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said Geburon. &ldquo;Do you not hold it a great wrong not to carry out
      the last wishes of departed friends?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Assuredly I do,&rdquo; said Parlamente; &ldquo;that is to say if the testator be in
      his right mind, and not raving.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you call it raving to give one&rsquo;s goods to the Church and the poor
      Mendicants?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not call it raving,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;if a man distribute what God
      has given into his hands among the poor; but to make alms of another
      person&rsquo;s goods is, in my opinion, no great wisdom. You will commonly see
      the greatest usurers build the handsomest and most magnificent chapels
      imaginable, thinking they may appease God with ten thousand ducats&rsquo; worth
      of building for a hundred thousand ducats&rsquo; worth of robbery, just as
      though God did not know how to count.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In sooth,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;I have many a time wondered how they can think
      to appease God for things which He Himself rebuked when He was on earth,
      such as great buildings, gildings, pictures and paint. If they really
      understood the passage in which God says to us that the only offering He
      requires from us is a contrite and humble heart, (4) and the other in
      which St. Paul says we are the temples of God wherein He desires to dwell,
      (5) they would be at pains to adorn their consciences while yet alive, and
      would not wait for the hour when man can do nothing more, whether good or
      evil, nor (what is worse) charge those who remain on earth to give their
      alms to folk upon whom, during their lifetime, they did not deign to look.
      But He who knows the heart cannot be deceived, and will judge them not
      according to their works, but according to their faith and charity towards
      Himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     4  &ldquo;The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and
     a contrite heart, O God, thou will not despise.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Psalm</i>
     li. 17.&mdash;Ed.

     5  &ldquo;For ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath
     said, I will dwell in them and walk in them,&rdquo; &amp;c.&mdash;2
     <i>Corinthians</i> vi. 16.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why is it, then,&rdquo; said Geburon, &ldquo;that these Grey Friars and Mendicants
      talk to us at our death of nothing but bestowing great benefits upon their
      monasteries, assuring us that they will put us into Paradise whether we
      will or not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How now, Geburon?&rdquo; said Hircan. &ldquo;Have you forgotten the wickedness you
      related to us of the Grey Friars, that you ask how such folk find it
      possible to lie? I declare to you that I do not think that there can be
      greater lies than theirs. Those, indeed, who speak on behalf of the whole
      community are not to be blamed, but there are some among them who forget
      their vows of poverty in order to satisfy their own greed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Methinks, Hircan,&rdquo; said Nomerfide, &ldquo;you must know some such tale, and if
      it be worthy of this company, I pray you tell it us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;although it irks me to speak of such folk.
      Methinks they are of the number of those of whom Virgil says to Dante,
      &lsquo;Pass on and heed them not.&rsquo; (6) Still, to show you that they have not
      laid aside their passions with their worldly garments, I will tell you of
      something that once came to pass.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     6  <i>Non ragioniam di lor, ma guarda e passa</i> (Dante&rsquo;s
     <i>Purgatorio</i>, iii. 51). The allusion is to the souls of
     those who led useless and idle lives on earth, supporting
     neither the Divinity by the observance of virtue, nor the
     spirit of evil by the practice of vice. They are thus cast
     out both from heaven and hell.&mdash;Ed.

      <i>TALE LVI</i>.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>A pious lady had recourse to a Grey Friar for his advice in
     providing her daughter with a good husband, for whom she
     proposed making it so profitable a match that the worthy
     father, hoping to get the money she intended for her son-in-
     law, married her daughter to a young comrade of his own. The
     latter came every evening to sup and lie with his wife, and
     in the morning returned in the garb of a scholar to his
     convent. But one day while he was chanting mass, his wife
     perceived him and pointed him out to her mother; who,
     however, could not believe that it was he until she had
     pulled off his coif while he was in bed, and from his tonsure
     learned the whole truth, and the deceit used by her father
     confessor</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      A French lady, whilst sojourning at Padua, was informed that there was a
      Grey Friar in the Bishop&rsquo;s prison there, and finding that every one spoke
      jestingly about him, she inquired the reason. She was told that this Grey
      Friar, who was an old man, had been confessor to a very honourable and
      pious widow lady, mother of only one daughter, whom she loved so dearly as
      to be at all pains to amass riches for her, and to find her a good
      husband. Now, seeing that her daughter was grown up, she was unceasingly
      anxious to find her a husband who might live with them in peace and quiet,
      a man, that is, of a good conscience, such as she deemed herself to
      possess. And since she had heard some foolish preacher say that it were
      better to do evil by the counsel of theologians than to do well through
      belief in the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, she had recourse to her
      father confessor, a man already old, a doctor of theology and one who was
      held to lead a holy life by the whole town, for she felt sure that, with
      his counsel and good prayers, she could not fail to find peace both for
      herself and for her daughter. After she had earnestly begged him to choose
      for her daughter such a husband as he knew a woman that loved God and her
      honour ought to desire, he replied that first of all it was needful to
      implore the grace of the Holy Spirit with prayer and fasting, and then,
      God guiding his judgment, he hoped to find what she required.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the Friar retired to think over the matter; and whereas he had heard
      from the lady that she had got five hundred ducats together to give to her
      daughter&rsquo;s husband, and that she would take upon herself the charge of
      maintaining both husband and wife with lodgment, furniture and clothes, he
      bethought himself that he had a young comrade of handsome figure and
      pleasing countenance, to whom he might give the fair maiden, the house,
      the furniture, maintenance and food, whilst he himself kept the five
      hundred ducats to gratify his burning greed. And when he spoke to his
      comrade of the matter, he found that they were both of one mind upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He therefore returned to the lady and said&mdash;&ldquo;I verily believe that
      God has sent his angel Raphael to me as he did to Tobit, to enable me to
      find a perfect husband for your daughter. I have in my house the most
      honourable gentleman in Italy, who has sometimes seen your daughter and is
      deeply in love with her. And so to-day, whilst I was at prayer, God sent
      him to me, and he told me of his desire for the marriage, whereupon,
      knowing his lineage and kindred and notable descent, I promised him to
      speak to you on the matter. There is, indeed, one defect in him, of which
      I alone have knowledge, and it is this. Wishing to save one of his friends
      whom another man was striving to slay, he drew his sword in order to
      separate them; but it chanced that his friend slew the other, and thus,
      although he himself had not dealt a blow, yet inasmuch as he had been
      present at a murder and had drawn his sword, he became a fugitive from his
      native town. By the advice of his kinsfolk he came hither in the garb of a
      scholar, and he dwells here unknown until his kinsfolk shall have ended
      the matter; and this he hopes will shortly be done. For this reason, then,
      it would be needful that the marriage should be performed in secret, and
      that you should suffer him to go in the daytime to the public lectures and
      return home every evening to sup and sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; replied the worthy woman, &ldquo;I look upon what you tell me as of great
      advantage to myself, for I shall at least have by me what I most desire in
      the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon the Grey Friar brought his comrade, bravely attired with a
      crimson satin doublet, and the lady was well pleased with him. And as soon
      as he was come the betrothal took place, and, immediately after midnight,
      a mass was said and they were married. Then they went to bed together
      until daybreak, when the bridegroom told his wife that to escape discovery
      he must needs return to the college.
    </p>
    <p>
      After putting on his crimson satin doublet and his long robe, without
      forgetting his coif of black silk, he bade his wife, who was still in bed,
      good-bye, promising that he would come every evening to sup with her, but
      that at dinner they must not wait for him. So he went away and left his
      wife, who esteemed herself the happiest woman alive to have found so
      excellent a match. And the young wedded Friar returned to the old father
      and brought him the five hundred ducats, as had been agreed between them
      when arranging the marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening he failed not to return and sup with her, who believed him
      to be her husband, and so well did he make himself liked by her and by his
      mother-in-law, that they would not have exchanged him for the greatest
      Prince alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      This manner of life continued for some time, but God in His kindness takes
      pity upon those that are deceived without fault of their own, and so in
      His mercy and goodness it came to pass that one morning the lady and her
      daughter felt a great desire to go and hear mass at St. Francis, (1) and
      visit their good father confessor through whose means they deemed
      themselves so well provided, the one with a son-in-law and the other with
      a husband.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  The church of the Grey Friars&rsquo; monastery, St Francis
     being their patron.&mdash;B. J.
</pre>
    <p>
      It chanced that they did not find the confessor aforesaid nor any other
      that they knew, and, while waiting to see whether the father would come,
      they were pleased to hear high mass, which was just beginning. And whilst
      the young wife was giving close heed to the divine service and its
      mystery, she was stricken with astonishment on seeing the Priest turn
      himself about to pronounce the <i>Dominus vobiscum</i>, for it seemed to
      her that it was her husband or else his very fellow. She uttered, however,
      not a word, but waited till he should turn round again, when, looking
      still more carefully at him, she had no doubt that it was indeed he. Then
      she twitched her mother, who was deep in contemplation, and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! madam, what is it that I see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; said her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is my husband,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;who is singing mass, or else &lsquo;tis one
      as like him as can be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pray you, my daughter,&rdquo; replied the mother, who had not carefully
      observed him, &ldquo;do not take such a thought into your head. It is impossible
      that men who are so holy should have practised such deceit. You would sin
      grievously against God if you believed such a thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless the mother did not cease looking at him, and when it came to
      the <i>Ite missa est</i> she indeed perceived that no two sons of the same
      mother were ever so much alike. Yet she was so simple that she would fain
      have said, &ldquo;O God, save me from believing what I see.&rdquo; Since her daughter
      was concerned in the matter, however, she would not suffer it to remain in
      uncertainty, and resolved to learn the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      When evening was come, and the husband (who had perceived nothing of them)
      was about to return, the mother said to her daughter&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall now, if you are willing, find out the truth concerning your
      husband. When he is in bed I will go to him, and then, while he is not
      thinking, you will pluck off his coif from behind, and we shall see
      whether he be tonsured like the Friar who said mass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As it was proposed, so was it done. As soon as the wicked husband was in
      bed, the old lady came and took both his hands as though in sport&mdash;her
      daughter took off his coif, and there he was with his fine tonsure. At
      this both mother and daughter were as greatly astonished as might be, and
      forthwith they called their servants to seize him and bind him fast till
      the morning, nor did any of his excuses or fine speeches avail him aught.
    </p>
    <p>
      When day was come, the lady sent for her confessor, making as though she
      had some great secret to tell him, whereupon he came with all speed, and
      then, reproaching him for the deceit that he had practised on her, she had
      him seized like the other. Afterwards she sent for the officers of
      justice, in whose hands she placed them both. It is to be supposed that if
      the judges were honest men they did not suffer the offence to go
      unpunished. (2)

     2  There is some little resemblance between this tale and
     the 36th of Morlini&rsquo;s <i>Novello, De monacho qui duxit

    <p>
      &ldquo;From this story, ladies, you will see that those who have taken vows of
      poverty are not free from the temptation of covetousness, which is the
      cause of so many ills.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, of so many blessings,&rdquo; said Saffredent, &ldquo;for with the five hundred
      ducats that the old woman would have stored up there was made much good
      cheer, while the poor maiden, who had been longing for a husband, was thus
      enabled to have two, and to speak with more knowledge as to the truth of
      all hierarchies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You always hold the falsest opinions,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;that ever I knew.
      You think that all women are of your own temper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so, madam, with your good leave,&rdquo; said Saffredent. &ldquo;I would give much
      that they were as easily satisfied as we are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a wicked speech,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;and there is not one present but
      knows the contrary, and that what you say is untrue. The story that has
      just been told proves the ignorance of poor women and the wickedness of
      those whom we regard as better than the rest of your sex; for neither
      mother nor daughter would do aught according to their own fancy, but
      subjected desire to good advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some women are so difficult,&rdquo; said Longarine, &ldquo;that they think they ought
      to have angels instead of men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And for that reason,&rdquo; said Simontault, &ldquo;they often meet with devils, more
      especially those who, instead of trusting to God&rsquo;s grace, think by their
      own good sense, or that of others, that they may in this world find some
      happiness, though this is granted by none save God, from whom alone it can
      come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How now, Simontault!&rdquo; said Oisille. &ldquo;I did not think that you knew so
      much good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said Simontault, &ldquo;&lsquo;tis a pity that I have not been proved, for I
      see that through lack of knowledge you have already judged ill of me. Yet
      I may well practise a Grey Friar&rsquo;s trade, since a Grey Friar has meddled
      with mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you call it your trade,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;to deceive women? Thus out
      of your mouth are you judged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had I deceived a hundred thousand,&rdquo; said Simontault, &ldquo;I should yet not
      have avenged the woes that I have endured for the sake of one alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;how often you complain of women; yet, for all
      that, we see you so merry and hearty that it is impossible to believe that

    <p>
      &ldquo;You quote a truly notable theologian,&rdquo; said Simontault, &ldquo;one who is not
      only froward himself, but makes all the ladies so, who have read and
      followed his teaching.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet his teaching,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;is as profitable for youthful dames
      as any that I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it were indeed true,&rdquo; said Simontault, &ldquo;that the ladies were without
      compassion, we might as well let our horses rest and our armour grow rusty
      until the next war, and think of nothing but household affairs. And, I
      pray you, tell me whether it is an excellence in a lady to have the
      reputation of being without pity, or charity, or love, or mercy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without charity or love,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;they should not be, but the
      word &lsquo;mercy&rsquo; sounds so ill among women that they cannot use it without
      wounding their honour; for properly speaking &lsquo;mercy&rsquo; means to grant a
      favour sought, and we well know what the favour is that men desire.&rdquo;

      <i>TALE LVII</i>.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>An English lord for seven years loved a lady without ever
     venturing to let her know of it, until one day, when
     observing her in a meadow, he lost all colour and control of
     feature through a sudden throbbing of the heart that came
     upon him. Then she, showing her compassion, at his request
     placed her gloved hand upon his heart, whereupon he pressed
     it so closely, whilst declaring to her the love he had so
     long borne her, that she withdrew it, leaving in its place
     her glove. And this glove he afterwards enriched with gems
     and fastened upon his doublet above his heart, and showed
     himself so graceful and virtuous a lover that he never
     sought any more intimate favour of her</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      King Louis the Eleventh (1) sent the Lord de Montmorency to England as his
      ambassador, and so welcome was the latter in that country that the King
      and all the Princes greatly esteemed and loved him, and even made divers
      of their private affairs known to him in order to have his counsel upon
      them.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  Some of the MS. say Louis XII., but we cannot find that
     either the eleventh or twelfth Louis sent any Montmorency as
     ambassador to England. Ripault-Desormeaux states, however,
     in his history of this famous French family, that William de
     Montmorency, who, after fighting in Italy under Charles
     VIII. and Louis XII., became, governor of the Orléanais and
     <i>chevalier d&rsquo;honneur</i> to Louise of Savoy was one of the
     signatories of the treaty concluded with Henry VIII. of
     England, after the-battle of Pavia in 1525. We know that
     Louise, as Regent of France, at that time sent John Brinon
     and John Joachim de Passano as ambassadors to England, and
     possibly William de Montmorency accompanied them, since
     Desormeaux expressly states that he guaranteed the loyal
     observance of the treaty then negotiated. William was the
     father of Anne, the famous Constable of France, and died May
     24, 1531. &ldquo;Geburon,&rdquo; in the dialogue following the above
     tale, mentions that he had well known the Montmorency
     referred to, and speaks of him as of a person dead and gone.
     It is therefore scarcely likely that Queen Margaret alludes
     to Francis de Montmorency, Lord of La Rochepot, who was only
     sent on a mission to England in 1546, and survived her by
     many years.&mdash;L. and Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      One day, at a banquet that the King gave to him, he was seated beside a
      lord (2) of high lineage, who had on his doublet a little glove, such as
      women wear, fastened with hooks of gold and so adorned upon the
      finger-seams with diamonds, rubies, emeralds and pearls, that it was
      indeed a glove of great price.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     2  The French word is <i>Millor (Milord)</i> and this is probably
     one of the earliest instances of its employment to designate
     a member of the English aristocracy. In such of the <i>Cent
     Nouvelles Nouvelles</i> in which English nobles figure, the
     latter are invariably called <i>seigneurs</i> or <i>chevaliers</i>,
     and addressed as <i>Monseigneur</i>, Later on, when Brantôme
     wrote, the term <i>un milord anglais</i> had become quite common,
     and he frequently makes use of it in his various works.
     English critics have often sneered at modern French writers
     for employing the expression, but it will be seen from this
     that they have simply followed a very old tradition.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      The Lord de Montmorency looked at it so often that the English lord
      perceived he was minded to inquire why it was so choicely ordered; so,
      deeming its story to be greatly to his own honour, he thus began&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can see that you think it strange I should have so magnificently
      arrayed a simple glove, and on my part I am still more ready to tell you
      the reason, for I deem you an honest gentleman and one who knows what
      manner of passion love is, so that if I did well in the matter you will
      praise me for it, and if not, make excuse for me, knowing that every
      honourable heart must obey the behests of love. You must know, then, that
      I have all my life long loved a lady whom I love still, and shall love
      even when I am dead, but, as my heart was bolder to fix itself worthily
      than were my lips to speak, I remained for seven years without venturing
      to make her any sign, through fear that, if she perceived the truth, I
      should lose the opportunities I had of often being in her company; and
      this I dreaded more than death. However, one day, while I was observing
      her in a meadow, a great throbbing of the heart came upon me, so that I
      lost all colour and control of feature. Perceiving this, she asked me what
      the matter was, and I told her that I felt an intolerable pain of the
      heart. She, believing it to be caused by a different sickness than love,
      showed herself pitiful towards me, which prompted me to beg her to lay her
      hand upon my heart and see how it was beating. This, more from charity
      than from any other affection, she did, and while I held her gloved hand
      against my heart, it began to beat and strain in such wise, that she felt
      that I was speaking the truth. Then I pressed her hand to my breast,
      saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Alas, madam, receive the heart which would fain break forth from my
      breast to leap into the hand of her from whom I look for indulgence, life
      and pity, and which now constrains me to make known to you the love that I
      have so long concealed, for neither my heart nor I can now control this
      potent God.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When she heard those words, she deemed them very strange. She wished to
      withdraw her hand, but I held it fast, and the glove remained in her cruel
      hand&rsquo;s place; and having neither before nor since had any more intimate
      favour from her, I have fastened this glove upon my heart as the best
      plaster I could give it. And I have adorned it with the richest rings I
      have, though the glove itself is wealth that I would not exchange for the
      kingdom of England, for I deem no happiness on earth so great as to feel
      it on my breast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Lord de Montmorency, who would have rather had a lady&rsquo;s hand than her
      glove, praised his very honourable behaviour, telling him that he was the
      truest lover he had ever known, and was worthy of better treatment, since
      he set so much value upon so slight a thing; though perchance, if he had
      obtained aught better than the glove, the greatness of his love might have
      made him die of joy. With this the English lord agreed, not suspecting
      that the Lord de Montmorency was mocking him. (3)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     3  Alluding to this story, Brantôme writes as follows in his
     <i>Dames Galantes</i>: &ldquo;You have that English <i>Milord</i> in the
     Hundred Tales of the Queen of Navarre, who wore his
     mistress&rsquo;s glove at his side, beautifully adorned. I myself
     have known many gentlemen who, before wearing their silken
     hose, would beg their ladies and mistresses to try them on
     and wear them for some eight or ten days, rather more than
     less, and who would then themselves wear them in extreme
     veneration and contentment, both of mind and body.&rdquo;&mdash;
     Lalanne&rsquo;s <i>OEuvres de Brantôme</i>, vol. ix. p. 309.&mdash;L.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If all men were so honourable as this one, the ladies might well trust
      them, since the cost would be merely a glove.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew the Lord de Montmorency well,&rdquo; said Geburon, &ldquo;and I am sure that
      he would not have cared to fare after the English fashion. Had he been
      contented with so little, he would not have been so successful in love as
      he was, for the old song says&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &lsquo;Of a cowardly lover
     No good is e&rsquo;er heard.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may be sure,&rdquo; said Saffredent, &ldquo;that the poor lady withdrew her hand
      with all speed, when she felt the beating of his heart, because she
      thought that he was about to die, and people say that there is nothing
      women loathe more than to touch dead bodies.&rdquo; (4)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     4  Most of this sentence, deficient in our MS., is taken
     from MS. No. 1520.&mdash;L.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you had spent as much time in hospitals as in taverns,&rdquo; said
      Ennasuite, &ldquo;you would not speak in that way, for you would have seen women
      shrouding dead bodies, which men, bold as they are, often fear to touch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; said Saffredent, &ldquo;that there is none upon whom penance has
      been laid but does the opposite of that wherein he formerly had delight,
      like a lady I once saw in a notable house, who, to atone for her delight
      in kissing one she loved, was found at four o&rsquo;clock in the morning kissing
      the corpse of a gentleman who had been killed the day before, and whom she
      had never liked more than any other. Then every one knew that this was a
      penance for past delights. But as all the good deeds done by women are
      judged ill by men, I am of opinion that, dead or alive, there should be no
      kissing except after the fashion that God commands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my part,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;I care so little about kissing women, except
      my own wife, that I will assent to any law you please, yet I pity the
      young folk whom you deprive of this trifling happiness, thus annulling the
      command of St. Paul, who bids us kiss <i>in osculo sancto.</i>&rdquo; (5)

    <p>
      &ldquo;If St. Paul had been such a man as you are,&rdquo; said Nomerfide, &ldquo;we should
      indeed have required proof of the Spirit of God that spoke in him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the end,&rdquo; said Geburon, &ldquo;you will doubt Holy Scripture rather than
      give up one of your petty affectations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God forbid,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;that we should doubt Holy Scripture, but we
      put small faith in your lies. There is no woman but knows what her belief
      should be, namely, never to doubt the Word of God or believe the word of
      man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet,&rdquo; said Simontauit, &ldquo;I believe that there are more men deceived by
      women than [women] by men. The slenderness of women&rsquo;s love towards us
      keeps them from believing our truths, whilst our exceeding love towards
      them makes us trust so completely in their falsehoods, that we are
      deceived before we suspect such a thing to be possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Methinks,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;you have been hearing some fool complain of
      being duped by a wanton woman, for your words carry but little weight, and
      need the support of an example. If, therefore, you know of one, I give you
      my place that you may tell it to us. I do not say that we are bound to
      believe you on your mere word, but it will assuredly not make our ears
      tingle to hear you speak ill of us, since we know what is the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, since it is for me to speak,&rdquo; said Dagoucin, &ldquo;&lsquo;tis I who will tell
      you the tale.&rdquo;

      <i>TALE LVIII.</i>
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>A gentleman, through putting too much trust in the
     truthfulness of a lady whom he had offended by forsaking her
     for others just when she was most in love with him, was, by
     a false tryst, deceived by her, and bemocked by the whole
     Court</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      At the Court of King Francis the First there was a lady (1) of excellent
      wit, who, by her grace, virtue and pleasantness of speech, had won the
      hearts of several lovers. With these she right well knew how to pass the
      time, but without hurt to her honour, conversing with them in such
      pleasant fashion that they knew not what to think, for those who were the
      most confident were reduced to despair, whilst those that despaired the
      most became hopeful. Nevertheless, while fooling most of them, she could
      not help greatly loving one whom she called her cousin, a name which
      furnished a pretext for closer fellowship.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  M. de Lincy surmises that Margaret is referring to
     herself both here and in the following tale, which concerns
     the same lady. His only reason for the supposition, however,
     is that the lady&rsquo;s views on certain love matters are akin to
     those which the Queen herself professed.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      However, as there is nothing in this world of firm continuance, their
      friendship often turned to anger and then was renewed in stronger sort
      than ever, so that the whole Court could not but be aware of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day the lady, both to let it be seen that she was wholly void of
      passion, and to vex him, for love of whom she had endured much annoyance,
      showed him a fairer countenance than ever she had done before. Thereupon
      the gentleman, who lacked boldness neither in love nor in war, began hotly
      to press the suit that he many a time previously had addressed to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She, pretending to be wholly vanquished by pity, promised to grant his
      request, and told him that she would with this intent go into her room,
      which was on a garret floor, where she knew there was nobody. And as soon
      as he should see that she was gone he was to follow her without fail, for
      he would find her ready to give proof of the good-will that she bore him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman, believing what she said, was exceedingly well pleased, and
      began to amuse himself with the other ladies until he should see her gone,
      and might quickly follow her. But she, who lacked naught of woman&rsquo;s
      craftiness, betook herself to my Lady Margaret, daughter of the King, and
      to the Duchess of Montpensier, (2) to whom she said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will if you are willing, show you the fairest diversion you have ever
      seen.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     2  The former is Margaret of France, Duchess of Savoy and
     Berry. Born in June 1523, she died in September 1574.&mdash;
     Queen Margaret was her godmother. When only three years old,
     she was promised in marriage to Louis of Savoy, eldest son
     of Duke Charles III., and he dying, she espoused his younger
     brother, Emmanuel Philibert, in July 1549. Graceful and
     pretty as a child (see <i>ante</i>, vol. i. p. xlviii.), she
     became, thanks to the instruction of the famous Michael de
     l&rsquo; Hôpital, one of the most accomplished women of her time,
     and Brantôme devotes an article to her in his <i>Dames
     Illustres</i> (Lalanne, v. viii. pp. 328-37). See also Hilarion
     de Coste&rsquo;s <i>Éloges et Vies des Reines, Princesses, &amp;c</i>.,
     Paris, 1647, vol. ii. p. 278.

     The Duchess of Montpensier, also referred to above, is
     Jacqueline de Longwick (now Longwy), Countess of Bar-sur-
     Seine, daughter of J. Ch. de Longwick, Lord of Givry, and of
     Jane, <i>bâtarde</i> of Angoulême. In 1538 Jacqueline was
     married to Louis II. de Bourbon, Duke of Montpensier. She
     gained great influence at the French Court, both under
     Francis I. and afterwards, and De Thou says of her that she
     was possessed of great wit and wisdom, far superior to the
     century in which she lived. She died in August 1561, and was
     the mother of Francis I., Duke of Montpensier, sometimes
     called the Dauphin of Auvergne, who fought at Jarnac,
     Moncontour, Arques, and Ivry, against Henry of Navarre.&mdash;L.,
     B. J. and Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      They, being by no means enamoured of melancholy, begged that she would
      tell them what it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know such a one,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;as worthy a gentleman as lives, and
      as bold. You are aware how many ill turns he has done me, and that, just
      when I loved him most, he fell in love with others, and so caused me more
      grief than I have ever suffered to be seen. Well, God has now afforded me
      the means of taking revenge upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am forthwith going to my own room, which is overhead, and immediately
      afterwards, if it pleases you to keep watch, you will see him follow me.
      When he has passed the galleries, and is about to go up the stairs, I pray
      you come both to the window and help me to cry &lsquo;Thief!&rsquo; You will then see
      his rage, which, I am sure, will not become him badly, and, even if he
      does not revile me aloud, I am sure he will none the less do so in his
      heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This plan was not agreed to without laughter, for there was no gentleman
      that tormented the ladies more than he did, whilst he was so greatly liked
      and esteemed by all, that for nothing in the world would any one have run
      the risk of his raillery.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed, moreover, to the two Princesses that they would themselves
      share in the glory which the other lady looked to win over this gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, as soon as they saw the deviser of the plot go out, they set
      themselves to observe the gentleman&rsquo;s demeanour. But little time went by
      before he shifted his quarters, and, as soon as he had passed the door,
      the ladies went out into the gallery, in order that they might not lose
      sight of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suspecting nothing, he wrapped his cloak about his neck, so as to hide his
      face, and went down the stairway to the court, but, seeing some one whom
      he did not desire to have for witness, he came back by another way, and
      then went down into the court a second time. The ladies saw everything
      without being perceived by him, and when he reached the stairway, by which
      he thought he might safely reach his sweetheart&rsquo;s chamber, they went to
      the window, whence they immediately perceived the other lady, who began
      crying out &lsquo;Thief!&rsquo; at the top of her voice; whereupon the two ladies
      below answered her so loudly that their voices were heard all over the
      castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      I leave you to imagine with what vexation the gentleman fled to his
      lodgings. He was not so well muffled as not to be known by those who were
      in the mystery, and they often twitted him with it, as did even the lady
      who had done him this ill turn, saying that she had been well revenged
      upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened, however, that he was so ready with his replies and evasions
      as to make them believe that he had quite suspected the plan, and had only
      consented to visit the lady in order to furnish them with some diversion,
      for, said he, he would not have taken so much trouble for her sake, seeing
      that his love for her had long since flown. The ladies would not admit the
      truth of this, so that the point is still in doubt; nevertheless, it is
      probable that he believed the lady. And since he was so wary and so bold
      that few men of his age and time could match and none could surpass him
      (as has been proved by his very brave and knightly death), (3) you must,
      it seems to me, confess that men of honour love in such wise as to be
      often duped, by placing too much trust in the truthfulness of the ladies.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     3  This naturally brings Bonnivet to mind, though of course
     the gay, rash admiral was not the only Frenchman of the time
     who spent his life in making love and waging war.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In good faith,&rdquo; said Ennasuite, &ldquo;I commend this lady for the trick she
      played; for when a man is loved by a lady and forsakes her for another,
      her vengeance cannot be too severe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;if she is loved by him; but there are some who
      love men without being certain that they are loved in return, and when
      they find that their sweethearts love elsewhere, they call them fickle. It
      therefore happens that discreet women are never deceived by such talk, for
      they give no heed or belief even to those people who speak truly, lest
      they should prove to be liars, seeing that the true and the false speak
      but one tongue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If all women were of your opinion,&rdquo; said Simon-tault, &ldquo;the gentlemen
      might pack up their prayers at once; but, for all that you and those like
      you may say, we shall never believe that women are as unbelieving as they
      are fair. And in this wise we shall live as content as you would fain
      render us uneasy by your maxims.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; said Longarine, &ldquo;knowing as I well do who the lady is that played
      that fine trick upon the gentleman, it is impossible for me not to believe
      in any craftiness on her part. Since she did not spare her husband, &lsquo;twere
      fitting she should not spare her lover.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her husband, say you?&rdquo; said Simontault. &ldquo;You know, then, more than I do,
      and so, since you wish it, I give you my place that you may tell us your
      opinion of the matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And since you wish it,&rdquo; said Longarine, &ldquo;I will do so.&rdquo;

      <i>TALE LIX</i>.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>This same lady, finding that her husband took it ill that
     she should have lovers with whom she amused herself without
     hurt to her honour, kept close watch upon him, and so
     discovered how pleasantly he addressed himself to one of her
     waiting-women. This woman she gained upon, made her consent
     to what her husband solicited, and then surprised him in
     such error that to atone for it, he was forced to confess
     that he deserved greater punishment than herself; by which
     means she was afterwards able to live as her fancy listed</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      The lady of your story was wedded to a rich gentleman of high and ancient
      lineage, and had married him on account of the great affection that they
      bore to one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being a woman most pleasant of speech, she by no means concealed from her
      husband that she had lovers whom she made game of for her pastime, and, at
      first, her husband shared in her pleasure. But at last this manner of life
      became irksome to him, for on the one part he took it ill that she should
      hold so much converse with those that were no kinsfolk or friends of his
      own, and on the other, he was greatly vexed by the expense to which he was
      put in sustaining her magnificence and in following the Court.
    </p>
    <p>
      He therefore withdrew to his own house as often as he was able, but so
      much company came thither to see him that the expenses of his household
      became scarcely any less, for, wherever his wife might be, she always
      found means to pass her time in sports, dances, and all such matters as
      youthful dames may use with honour. And when sometimes her husband told
      her, laughing, that their expenses were too great, she would reply that
      she promised never to make him a &ldquo;coqu&rdquo; or cuckold, but only a &ldquo;coquin,&rdquo;
       that is, a beggar; for she was so exceedingly fond of dress, that she must
      needs have the bravest and richest at the Court. (1) Her husband took her
      thither as seldom as possible, but she did all in her power to go, and to
      this end behaved in a most loving fashion towards her husband, who would
      not willingly have refused her a much harder request.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  As Queen Margaret was by no means over fond of gorgeous
     apparel and display, this passage is in contradiction with
     M. de Lincy&rsquo;s surmise that the lady of this and the
     preceding tale may be herself. In any case the narrative
     could only apply to the period of her first marriage, and
     this was in no wise a love-match. Yet we are told at the
     outset of the above story that the lady and gentleman had
     married on account of the great affection between them. On
     the other hand, these details may have been introduced the
     better to conceal the identity of the persons referred to.&mdash;
     Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      Now one day, when she had found that all her devices could not induce him
      to make this journey to the Court, she perceived that he was very pleasant
      in manner with a chamber-woman (2) she had, and thereupon thought she
      might turn the matter to her own advantage. Taking the girl apart, she
      questioned her cleverly, using both wiles and threats, in such wise that
      the girl confessed that, ever since she had been in the house, not a day
      had passed on which her master had not sought her love; but (she added)
      she would rather die than do aught against God and her honour, more
      especially after the honour which the lady had done her in taking her into
      her service, for this would make such wickedness twice as great.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     2  The French expression here is <i>femme de chambre à
     chaperon</i>. The <i>chaperon</i> in this instance was a cap with a
     band of velvet worn across it as a sign of gentle and even
     noble birth. The attendant referred to above would therefore
     probably be a young woman of good descent, constrained by
     circumstances to enter domestic service.&mdash;B. J. and Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      On hearing of her husband&rsquo;s unfaithfulness, the lady immediately felt both
      grief and joy. Her grief was that her husband, despite all his show of
      loving her, should be secretly striving to put her to so much shame in her
      own household, and this when she believed herself far more beautiful and
      graceful than the woman whom he sought in her stead. But she rejoiced to
      think that she might surprise her husband in such manifest error that he
      would no longer be able to reproach her with her lovers, nor with her
      desire to dwell at Court; and, to bring this about, she begged the girl
      gradually to grant her husband what he sought upon certain conditions that
      she made known to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl was minded to make some difficulty, but when her mistress
      warranted the safety both of her life and of her honour, she consented to
      do whatever might be her pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman, on continuing his pursuit of the girl, found her
      countenance quite changed towards him, and therefore urged his suit more
      eagerly than had been his wont; but she, knowing by heart the part she had
      to play, made objection of her poverty, and said that, if she complied
      with his desire, she would be turned away by her mistress, in whose
      service she looked to gain a good husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman forthwith replied that she need give no thought to any such
      matters, since he would bestow her in marriage more profitably than her
      mistress would be able to do, and further, would contrive the matter so
      secretly that none would know of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon this they came to an agreement, and, on considering what place would
      be most suited for such a fine business, the girl said that she knew of
      none better or more remote from suspicion than a cottage in the park,
      where there was a chamber and a bed suitable for the occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman, who would not have thought any place unsuitable, was
      content with the one she named, and was very impatient for the appointed
      day and hour to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl kept her word to her mistress, and told her in full the whole
      story of the plan, and how it was to be put into execution on the morrow
      after dinner. She would not fail, said she, to give a sign when the time
      came to go to the cottage, and she begged her mistress to be watchful, and
      in no wise fail to be present at the appointed hour, in order to save her
      from the danger into which her obedience was leading her.
    </p>
    <p>
      This her mistress swore, begging her to be without fear, and promising
      that she would never forsake her, but would protect her from her husband&rsquo;s
      wrath.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the morrow was come and dinner was over, the gentleman was more
      pleasant with his wife than ever, and although this was not very agreeable
      to her, she dissembled so well that he did not perceive the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner she asked him how he was minded to pass away the time, and he
      answered that he knew of nothing better than to play at &ldquo;cent.&rdquo; (3)
      Forthwith everything was made ready for the game, but the lady pretended
      that she did not care to take part in it, and would find diversion enough
      in looking at the players.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     3  This is probably a reference to the card game now called
     piquet, usually played for a hundred points. It is one of
     the oldest of its kind. See Rabelais&rsquo; <i>Gargantua</i>, book i.
     chap, xxii.&mdash;L.
</pre>
    <p>
      Just before he sat down to play, the gentleman failed not to ask the girl
      to remember her promise to him, and while he was playing she passed
      through the room, making a sign to her mistress which signified that she
      was about to set out on the pilgrimage she had to make. The sign was
      clearly seen by the lady, but her husband perceived nothing of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later, however, one of his servants made him a sign from a
      distance, whereupon he told his wife that his head ached somewhat, and
      that he must needs rest and take the air. She, knowing the nature of his
      sickness as well as he did himself, asked him whether she should play in
      his stead, and he consented, saying that he would very soon return.
      However, she assured him that she could take his place for a couple of
      hours without weariness.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the gentleman withdrew to his room, and thence by an alley into his
      park.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady, who knew another and shorter way, waited for a little while, and
      then, suddenly feigning to be seized with colic, gave her hand at play to
      another.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as she was out of the room, she put off her high-heeled shoes and
      ran as quickly as she could to the place, where she had no desire that the
      bargain should be struck without her. And so speedily did she arrive,
      that, when she entered the room by another door, her husband was but just
      come in. Then, hiding herself behind the door, she listened to the fair
      and honest discourse that he held to her maid. But when she saw that he
      was coming near to the criminal point, she seized him from behind, saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, I am too near that you should take another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is needless to ask whether the gentleman was in extreme wrath, both at
      being balked of the delight he had looked to obtain, and at having his
      wife, whose affection he now greatly feared to lose for ever, know more of
      him than he desired. He thought, however, that the plot had been contrived
      by the girl, and (without speaking to his wife) he ran after her with such
      fury that, had not his wife rescued her from his hands, he would have
      killed her. He declared that she was the wickedest jade he had ever known,
      and that, if his wife had waited to see the end, she would have found that
      he was only mocking her, for, instead of doing what she expected, he would
      have chastised her with rods.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his wife, knowing what words of the sort were worth, set no value upon
      them, and addressed such reproaches to him that he was in great fear lest
      she should leave him. He promised her all that she asked, and, after her
      sage reproaches, confessed that it was wrong of him to complain that she
      had lovers; since a fair and honourable woman is none the less virtuous
      for being loved, provided that she do or say nothing contrary to her
      honour; whereas a man deserves heavy punishment when he is at pains to
      pursue a woman that loves him not, to the wronging of his wife and his own
      conscience. He would therefore, said he, never more prevent his wife from
      going to Court, nor take it ill that she should have lovers, for he knew
      that she spoke with them more in jest than in affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      This talk was not displeasing to the lady, for it seemed to her that she
      had gained an important point. Nevertheless she spoke quite to the
      contrary, pretending that she had no delight in going to Court, since she
      no longer possessed his love, without which all assemblies were
      displeasing to her; and saying that a woman who was truly loved by her
      husband, and who loved him in return, as she did, carried with her a
      safe-conduct that permitted her to speak with one and all, and to be
      derided by none.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor gentleman was at so much pains to assure her of the love he bore
      her, that at last they left the place good friends. That they might not
      again fall into such trouble, he begged her to turn away the girl through
      whom he had undergone so much distress. This she did, but did it by
      bestowing her well and honourably in marriage, and at her husband&rsquo;s
      expense.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, to make the lady altogether forget his folly, the gentleman soon took
      her to Court, in such style and so magnificently arrayed that she had good
      reason to be content.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This, ladies, was what made me say I did not find the trick she played
      upon one of her lovers a strange one, knowing, as I did, the trick she had
      played upon her husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have described to us a very cunning wife and a very stupid husband,&rdquo;
       said Hircan. &ldquo;Having advanced so far, he ought not to have come to a
      standstill and stopped on so fair a road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what should he have done?&rdquo; said Longarine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What he had taken in hand to do,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;for his wife was no less
      wrathful with him for his intention to do evil than she would have been
      had he carried the evil into execution. Perchance, indeed, she would have
      respected him more if she had seen that he was a bolder gallant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all very well,&rdquo; said Ennasuite, &ldquo;but where will you find a man to
      face two women at once? His wife would have defended her rights and the
      girl her virginity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;but a strong bold man does not fear to assail two
      that are weak, nor will he ever fail to vanquish them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I readily understand,&rdquo; said Ennasuite, &ldquo;that if he had drawn his sword he
      might have killed them both, but otherwise I cannot see that he had any
      means of escape. I pray you, therefore, tell us what you would have done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have taken my wife in my arms,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;and have carried
      her out. Then I should have had my own way with her maid by love or by
      force.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis enough, Hircan,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;that you know how to do evil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure, Parlamente,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;that I do not scandalise the
      innocence in whose presence I speak, and by what I have said I do not mean
      that I support a wicked deed. But I wonder at the attempt, which was in
      itself worthless, and at the attempter, who, for fear rather than for love
      of his wife, failed to complete it. I praise a man who loves his wife as
      God ordains; but when he does not love her, I think little of him for
      fearing her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; replied Parlamente, &ldquo;if love did not render you a good husband, I
      should make small account of what you might do through fear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quite safe, Parlamente,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;for the love I bear you
      makes me more obedient than could the fear of either death or hell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may say what you please,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;but I have reason to be
      content with what I have seen and known of you. As for what I have not
      seen, I have never wished to make guess or still less inquiry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it great folly,&rdquo; said Nomerfide, &ldquo;for women to inquire so
      curiously concerning their husbands, or husbands concerning their wives.
      Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof, without giving so much heed
      to the morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet it is sometimes needful,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;to inquire into matters that
      may touch the honour of a house in order to set them right, though not to
      pass evil judgment upon persons, seeing that there is none who does not
      fail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Many,&rdquo; said Geburon, &ldquo;have at divers times fallen into trouble for lack
      of well and carefully inquiring into the errors of their wives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pray you,&rdquo; said Longarine, &ldquo;if you know any such instance, do not keep
      it from us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do indeed know one,&rdquo; said Geburon, &ldquo;and since you so desire, I will
      relate it.&rdquo;

      <i>TALE LX</i>.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>A man of Paris, through not making good inquiry concerning
     his wife, whom he believed dead, though she was indeed
     making good cheer with a chanter to the King, married a
     second wife, whom, after having several children by her and
     consorting with her for fourteen or fifteen years, he was
     constrained to leave, in order to take his first wife back
     again</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      In the city of Paris there was a man who was so good-natured that he would
      have scrupled to believe a man abed with his wife, even if he had seen him
      with his own eyes. This poor man married a woman whose conduct was as bad
      as could be; nevertheless he perceived nothing of it, and treated her as
      though she were the most virtuous woman alive. One day, however, when King
      Louis XII. came to Paris, his wife surrendered herself to one of the
      choir-men of the aforesaid sovereign, and when she found that the King was
      leaving Paris and that she would no longer be able to see the singer, she
      resolved to follow him and forsake her husband. To this the chanter
      agreed, and brought her to a house that he had near Blois, (1) where for a
      long while they lived together. The poor husband, finding that he had lost
      his wife, sought her everywhere; and at last it was told him that she was
      gone away with the chanter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wishing to recover the lost ewe which he had so badly watched, he wrote
      many letters to her begging her to return to him, and saying that he would
      take her back if she were willing to be a virtuous woman. But she took
      such great delight in listening to the songs of the chanter, that she had
      forgotten her husband&rsquo;s voice, and gave no heed to all his excellent
      words, but mocked at them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore the husband, in great wrath, gave her to know that, since she
      would return to him in no other way, he would demand her in legal fashion
      of the Church. (2) The wife, dreading that if the law should take the
      matter in hand she and her chanter would fare badly, devised a stratagem
      worthy of such a woman as herself. Feigning sickness, she sent for some
      honourable women of the town to come and see her, and this they willingly
      did, hoping that her illness might be a means of withdrawing her from her
      evil life, with which purpose they addressed the sagest admonitions to
      her. Thereupon she, whilst pretending to be grievously sick, made a show
      of weeping and acknowledging her sinfulness in such sort that she gained
      the pity of the whole company, who quite believed that she was speaking
      from the bottom of her heart. And, finding her thus subdued and sorry,
      they began to comfort her, telling her that God was in no wise so terrible
      as many preachers represented Him, and that He would never refuse to show
      her mercy.
    </p>

     1  Louis XII.&lsquo;s favourite place of residence.&mdash;Ed.

     2  Implying the Officialité or episcopal court.&mdash;B. J.
</pre>
    <p>
      After this excellent discourse, they sent for a virtuous man to come and
      confess her, and on the morrow the priest of the parish came to administer
      the Holy Sacrament. This she received so piously, that all the virtuous
      women of the town who were present wept to see her devoutness, praising
      God, who of His goodness had in this wise shown compassion upon this poor
      creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards she pretended that she could no longer take food, whereupon the
      extreme unction was brought by the priest and received by her with many
      pious signs; for (as they thought) she was scarcely able to speak. She
      continued thus for a great while, and it seemed as though she were
      gradually losing her sight, hearing and other senses, whereat there came
      from all a cry of &ldquo;Jesus!&rdquo; As night was at hand and the ladies were far
      from home, they all withdrew; and just as they were leaving the house it
      was told them that she was dead, whereupon, saying their <i>De profundis</i>
      for her, they returned to their houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest asked the chanter where he would have her buried, and the other
      replied that she had desired to be buried in the cemetery, and that it
      would be well to bring her there at night. So the poor unfortunate was
      shrouded by a serving-woman, who was careful not to hurt her, and then by
      brave torchlight she was carried to the grave that the chanter had caused
      to be made.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the body passed in front of the houses of those who had been present
      when she received the extreme unction, they all came forth and followed
      her to the tomb; and there she was soon left by women and priests alike.
      The chanter, however, did not go away, but, as soon as he saw the company
      some distance off, he and the serving-woman opened the grave wherein was
      his sweetheart more alive than ever, and he sent her secretly to his
      house, where for a long time he kept her concealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The husband, who was in pursuit of her, came as far as Blois to demand
      justice, when he found that she was dead and buried according to the
      testimony of all the ladies of Blois. They told him, too, what a good end
      she had made, and the worthy man was rejoiced to think that his wife&rsquo;s
      soul was in Paradise, and himself rid of her wicked body.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this wise well content, he betook himself back to Paris, where he
      married a beautiful and virtuous young woman, and a good housewife, by
      whom he had several children, and with whom he lived for fourteen or
      fifteen years. But at last rumour, which can keep nothing hid, advised him
      that his wife was not dead, but was still dwelling with the wicked
      chanter. The poor man concealed the matter as well as he was able,
      pretending to know nothing about it, and hoping that it was a lie. But his
      wife, who was a discreet woman, was told of it, and such was her anguish
      at the tidings that she was like to die of grief. Had it been possible
      without offence to her conscience, she would gladly have concealed her
      misfortune, but it was not possible. The Church immediately took the
      affair in hand, and first of all separated them from each other until the
      truth of the matter should be known.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then was this poor man obliged to leave the good and go after the bad, and
      in this wise he came to Blois shortly after Francis the First had become
      king. Here he found Queen Claude and my Lady the Regent, (3) to whom he
      made his complaint, asking for her whom he would gladly not have found,
      but whom, to the great compassion of the whole company, he was now obliged
      to see.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     3  This shows that the incidents of the tale occurred in the
     summer or autumn of 1515, when Francis I. was absent in
     Italy conducting the campaign which resulted in the victory
     of Marignano and the surrender of Milan.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      When his wife was brought before him, she strove for a long while to
      maintain that he was not her husband, which he would willingly have
      believed had he been able. More disappointed than abashed, she told him
      that she would rather die than go back with him, and at this he was well
      pleased; but the ladies in whose presence she spoke in this unseemly
      fashion condemned her to return, and so rated the chanter with many a
      threat, that he was obliged to tell his ugly sweetheart to go back with
      her husband, and to declare that he himself would never see her more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rejected thus on all sides, the poor unfortunate withdrew to a home in
      which she was fated to meet with better treatment from her husband than
      she had deserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, ladies, why I say that if the poor husband had been more
      watchful over his wife, he would not thus have lost her. A thing that is
      well guarded is difficult to lose, but heedlessness makes the thief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis a strange thing,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;how strong love is just where it
      seems most unreasonable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard,&rdquo; said Simontault, &ldquo;that it were easier to break two
      marriages than to sunder the love of a priest and his serving-maid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe it,&rdquo; said Ennasuite; &ldquo;for those who bind others together in
      marriage, are so well able to tie the knot that nought but death can
      destroy it. Theologians, moreover, hold that spiritual language is of more
      effect than any other, and in consequence spiritual love surpasses any
      other kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a thing that I cannot forgive in ladies,&rdquo; said Dagoucin, &ldquo;when they
      forsake an honourable husband or a lover for a priest, however handsome
      and worthy the latter may be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pray you, Dagoucin,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;intermeddle not with our Holy Mother
      Church. Be assured that &lsquo;tis a great delight for timorous and
      secret-loving women to sin with those who can absolve them; for there are
      some who are more ashamed to confess a thing than to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;of those who have no knowledge of God, and who
      think not that secret matters are one day revealed in presence of the
      Company of Heaven. But I think that it is not for confession&rsquo;s sake that
      they go after confessors; for the Enemy has so blinded them that they are
      more concerned to attach themselves where they think there is most
      concealment and security, than anxious to obtain absolution for the
      wickedness of which they do not repent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Repent, say you?&rdquo; said Saffredent. &ldquo;Nay, they deem themselves holier than
      other women. I am sure that there are some who deem it honourable in
      themselves that they are constant in such love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak in such a manner,&rdquo; said Oisille to Saffredent, &ldquo;that I think
      you know of some one of that kind. I pray you, therefore, begin the Day
      tomorrow by telling us what you know. But now the last bell for vespers is
      already ringing; for our friends the monks went off as soon as they had
      heard the tenth tale, and left us to finish our discussions among
      ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At these words they all rose and came to the church, where they found the
      monks awaiting them. Then, after hearing vespers, they all supped
      together, talking the while of many excellent stories. After supper they
      went, according to their wont, to disport themselves somewhat in the
      meadow, and then retired to rest, in order that their memories might be
      the sounder on the morrow.

      PROLOGUE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the morning the Lady Oisille failed not to administer to them wholesome
      nutriment, which she did by reading of the acts and virtuous deeds of the
      glorious knights and apostles of Jesus Christ, as related by St. Luke,
      telling them withal that these relations should suffice to make them long
      for the return of such a time, and to make them weep for the uncomeliness
      of this age as compared with that. When she had sufficiently read and
      expounded to them the beginning of this excellent book, she begged them to
      go to the church in such union as that in which the Apostles were wont to
      pray, seeking of God the mercy which is never refused to those who ask for
      it in faith. Her counsel was approved by all, and they came to the church
      just as the Mass of the Holy Spirit was beginning; this seemed to them
      very apt to the occasion, and they hearkened to the service in great
      devotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards they went to dinner, where they called to mind the apostolic
      life, and took such great delight in it that it was as though their
      undertaking had been forgotten. But Nomerfide, who was the youngest,
      noticed this, and said, &ldquo;The Lady Oisille has made us so devout that we
      are letting slip the hour at which we are wont to withdraw, in order to
      make ready for the relating of our tales.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her words caused the whole company to rise, and, after they had been for a
      while in their rooms, they failed not to repair to the meadow as on the
      day before. When they were seated at their ease, the Lady Oisille said to
      Saffredent, &ldquo;Although I am certain that you will say nothing to the
      advantage of women, yet I must call upon you to tell the tale that you had
      in readiness yester evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I protest, madam,&rdquo; replied Saffredent, &ldquo;against winning the repute of a
      slanderer through telling the truth, or losing the favour of virtuous
      ladies through relating the deeds of the wanton. I have felt what it is to
      lack their presence, and had I equally lacked their fair favours, I had
      not been alive to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he turned his eyes away from her who was the cause of his
      happiness and of his woe; and, looking upon Ennasuite, caused her to blush
      as deeply as though his words had been directed to her. Yet was he none
      the less understood by her whom he desired should understand him. The Lady
      Oisille then assured him that he might freely speak the truth at the cost
      of any person concerned; whereupon he thus began:&mdash;

    <p>
      Near the town of Autun there lived a very beautiful woman, who was tall,
      fair, and as handsome of feature as any I have ever seen. She was married
      to an honest man who seemed somewhat younger than herself, and who loved
      and treated her well enough to give her reason for content.

    <p>
      A little while after they were married, he took her to the town of Autun,
      where he had business; and while he was engaged with the law, his wife
      would go to the church to pray God for him.

    <p>
      She repaired so often to this holy place that a very rich Canon fell in
      love with her, and wooed her so urgently that the unhappy creature gave
      herself up to him. Her husband had no suspicion of this, however, for he
      gave more thought to the guarding of his property than of his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the time for departure was come, and they must needs return to their
      home, which was full seven leagues from the town, great was the woman&rsquo;s
      sorrow. But the Canon promised that he would often go and see her, and
      this he did, pretending to be making some journey which led him past the
      house. The gentleman, however, was not so foolish as not to perceive the
      truth, and he so skilfully contrived matters, that when the Canon came
      thither he no longer met the wife, who was too well hidden by her husband
      to allow of his having any speech with her. The wife, knowing her
      husband&rsquo;s jealousy, gave no sign that this was displeasing to her;
      nevertheless, she resolved to set things to rights, for she felt herself
      as it were in hell, deprived as she was of the sight of her God.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, when her husband was abroad, she found a means to occupy her
      servants, both men and women, after such a fashion that she was left alone
      in the house. Immediately, she took what was needful, and, with no company
      save that of the wanton love she carried with her, she repaired on foot to
      Autun. Here she arrived none too late to be recognised by her Canon, who
      kept her shut up in hiding for more than a year, and this in spite of the
      monitions and excommunications that were procured against him by her
      husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter, finding that he had no other remedy, at last complained to the
      Bishop, who had an Archdeacon, as worthy a man as any at that time in
      France. This Archdeacon himself searched with great diligence through all
      the Canon&rsquo;s houses, until he discovered the one in which the woman was
      being kept in concealment, whereupon he cast her into prison, and laid
      heavy penance upon the Canon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The husband, knowing that his wife had been recovered by the counsels of
      the Archdeacon and divers other excellent persons, was content to take her
      back on her swearing to him that she would live for the future as beseemed
      a virtuous woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      This the worthy man in his deep love for her readily believed, and,
      bringing her back to his house, he treated her as honourably as before,
      except that he gave her two old serving-women who never left her, one or
      other of them being at all times with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, however kindly her husband might use her, the wicked love she bore
      towards the Canon caused her to regard all rest as torment. And although
      she was a very beautiful woman and her husband a man of excellent
      constitution, vigorous and strong, she never had any children by him, her
      heart being always seven leagues away from her body; this, however, she
      concealed so well that it seemed to her husband that, like himself, she
      had wholly forgotten the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in her great wickedness she was not so minded; for, just when she saw
      her husband most in love with her and having least suspicion, she
      pretended to fall ill, and continued in this pretence until her husband
      was in wondrous distress, and anxious to spare nought that might relieve
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, she played her part so exceedingly well that he, and all in the
      house, thought that she was sick unto death, and was growing by degrees
      weaker and weaker. Finding that her husband was no less grieved than he
      should have been glad, she begged of him that he would authorise her to
      make her will, and this with tears he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having power of bequest, although she had no children, she gave to her
      husband what she could, craving at the same time his forgiveness for her
      wrong-doing towards him. Then she sent for the priest, confessed herself,
      and received the Holy Sacrament of the Altar with such devoutness, that
      all wept to see so glorious an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the evening was come, she begged her husband to send for the extreme
      unction, saying that, as she was growing very weak, she was in fear lest
      she might not live to receive it. Her husband in all haste caused it to be
      brought by the priest, and she, by receiving it with very great humility,
      prompted every one to praise her.
    </p>
    <p>
      After she had got through her brave mysteries, she told her husband that,
      having through God&rsquo;s grace received all that the Church commands, she felt
      great peace of conscience, and would fain take some rest; and she begged
      him to do the like, seeing that he had great need of it after all his
      weeping and watching with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      When her husband was gone, and all his servants with him, the poor old
      women, who had so long watched her in health and now had no fear of losing
      her except by death, went contentedly and comfortably to bed. As soon as
      she heard them asleep and loudly snoring, she rose in nothing but her
      shift, and went out of the room, listening to hear if any one was yet
      astir in the house. Taking every precaution, she then (as she well knew
      how) let herself out through a little garden-gate that was not shut, and,
      barefooted and in her shift, journeyed all night long towards Autun and
      the saint, who had preserved her from death.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened, however, that as the distance was great, she could not
      accomplish the whole of it before daylight overtook her. Looking then all
      along the road, she perceived two horsemen who were galloping at full
      speed, and thinking that it might be her husband in search of her, she hid
      herself entirely in a marsh, with her head among the reeds. As her husband
      (for he it was) passed close beside her, he spoke to a servant who was
      with him, in tones of deep despair, saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, the wicked woman! Who could have thought that so foul and abominable
      a deed could be hidden under cloak of the holy sacraments of the Church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Judas,&rdquo; replied the servant, &ldquo;feared not to betray his Master when he
      was receiving the like, a woman&rsquo;s treachery is but small matter for
      wonder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this point the husband passed on, and his wife remained among the
      rushes, in greater gladness at having deceived and escaped him than she
      had ever felt at home in a good bed but in subjection.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor husband sought her through all the town of Autun, but learning
      for certain that she had not entered it, he retraced his steps,
      complaining unceasingly of her and of his loss, and threatening her with
      nothing short of death if he should find her. Of this she had as little
      fear in her mind as she had of cold in her body, although the place and
      season might well have caused her to repent of her evil journey. And any
      one who did not know how the fire of hell inflames those that are filled
      with it, must needs wonder how it was that this unhappy woman could so
      leave a warm bed and continue for a whole day in the piercing cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet she neither lost courage nor gave up the journey, but, as soon as
      night was come, went forward once more. Just as the gate at Autun was
      being closed, this pilgrim arrived thither and repaired straight to the
      shrine of her saint, who was in great wonder at her coming, and could
      scarcely believe that it was indeed she. But when he had carefully looked
      at her and examined her at all points, he found that, unlike a spirit, she
      was really possessed of bone and flesh, and so became convinced that she
      was no ghost.
    </p>
    <p>
      And thenceforward they agreed so well together that she dwelt with the
      Canon for fourteen or fifteen years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although for a time she lived in concealment, in the end she lost all
      fear, and (what is worse) became so exceedingly proud of her lover that at
      church she would set herself before most of the honourable women of the
      town, wives of officials and others. Moreover, she had children by the
      Canon, and among others a daughter who was married to a rich merchant, and
      who had so magnificent a wedding that all the women of the town murmured
      exceedingly, yet were powerless to set the affair to rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it happened that at this time Queen Claude, wife of King Francis,
      passed through the town of Autun, having with her my Lady the Regent,
      mother of the King aforesaid, and the Duchess of Alençon, her daughter.
      (1) One of the Queen&rsquo;s waiting-women, named Perrette, came to the Duchess
      and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam, I pray you listen to me, and you will do a better deed than if you
      went to hear the whole day&rsquo;s service at the church.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  This would have occurred in the late autumn of 1515, when
     the Court journeyed southward to meet Francis I. on his
     return from the Marignano campaign.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      The Duchess gave ready heed, knowing that nought but good counsel could
      come from her. Then Perrette forthwith told her how she had taken a young
      girl to help her in washing the Queen&rsquo;s linen, and how, on asking the news
      of the town, she had heard from her the vexation which all the honourable
      women endured at seeing the Canon&rsquo;s mistress go before them, together with
      some of the history of the wicked woman&rsquo;s life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duchess went immediately to the Queen and my Lady the Regent, and told
      them the story; and they, without any form of law, sent for the unhappy
      woman. The latter sought no concealment, for her shame was turned to pride
      at being mistress in the household of so rich a man; and hence, with no
      feeling of confusion or disgrace, she presented herself before the ladies
      aforesaid, who were so abashed by her hardihood that at first they knew
      not what to say. After a time, however, my Lady the Regent rebuked her in
      a fashion which would have made a right-thinking woman weep, though this
      unhappy creature did not do so, but with great boldness said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pray you, ladies, let my honour go unscathed, for, God be praised, I
      have lived so well and virtuously with the Canon that no person alive can
      say aught against me. And let it not be thought that I am living in
      opposition to the will of God, since, for three years past, the Canon has
      not come near me, and we live together as chastely and as lovingly as two
      little angels, without any speech or wish between us to the contrary. And
      any one separating us will commit a great sin, for the worthy man, who is
      nigh eighty years old, will not live long without me, who am forty-five.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      You may imagine how the ladies then comported themselves, and what
      remonstrance they all made with her; but, in spite of the words that were
      spoken, and her own age, and the honourable indignation of those present,
      her obstinacy was not softened. That she might be the more effectually
      humbled, they sent for the good Archdeacon of Autun, and he condemned her
      to lie in prison for a year, faring on bread and water. The ladies further
      sent for her husband, and he, after hearing their excellent exhortations,
      was content to take her back again after she should have performed her
      penance.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when she found that she was a prisoner, and that the Canon was
      resolved to have her back no more, she thanked the ladies for having taken
      a devil off her shoulders, and showed such deep and perfect contrition
      that her husband, instead of waiting until the year should have expired,
      came and asked her of the Archdeacon before a fortnight was over; and
      since then they have lived together in all peace and affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, ladies, how the chains of St. Peter are by wicked ministers
      converted into those of Satan, which it is so hard to break that even the
      sacraments, which cast out devils from the body, are here the means of
      making them abide longer in the conscience; for the best things, when
      abused, bring about most evil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;this woman was a very wicked one, but at the same
      time she was well punished by her appearance before such judges as the
      ladies you have named. The mere glance of the Lady Regent had such power
      that never was there a woman, however virtuous, that did not dread being
      found unworthy in her sight. Those who were looked upon kindly by her
      deemed that they had earned a high honour, knowing as they did that none
      but virtuous women were favoured by her.&rdquo; (2)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     2  We are asked to believe that Oisille is none other than
     the Lady Regent (Louise of Savoy), but is it likely she
     would thus speak of herself? We can scarcely conceive Queen
     Margaret perpetrating such a flagrant anachronism.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It were indeed a fine thing,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;that there should be greater
      dread of a woman&rsquo;s eyes than of the Holy Sacrament, which, if it be not
      received in faith and charity, brings with it eternal damnation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;who are not inspired by God are, I promise you,
      in greater dread of the temporal than of the spiritual powers. And I
      believe that the poor creature was brought to mend her ways rather by her
      imprisonment and the thought of seeing her Canon no more, than by any
      remonstrance that might have been made to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said Simontault, &ldquo;you have forgotten the chief cause of her return
      to her husband, which was that the Canon was eighty years old, whilst her
      husband was younger than herself; so the worthy lady had the best of all
      her bargains. Had the Canon been young, she would not have been willing to
      forsake him, and the admonitions of the ladies would have been as
      ineffectual as the sacraments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Further,&rdquo; said Nomerfide, &ldquo;I think she did well not to confess her sin so
      readily; such an offence ought to be humbly acknowledged to God, but
      stoutly denied before men. Even though it be true, still, by deception and
      swearing, doubt may be cast upon it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; said Longarine. &ldquo;A sin can scarcely be so secret that it will
      not become revealed, unless God in His pity conceal it, as in the case of
      those who for love of Himself have truly repented.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;will you say of those women who have no sooner
      done a deed of folly than they tell some one about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that a strange thing,&rdquo; answered Longarine, &ldquo;and a sign that sin
      is not displeasing to them. If, as I said, a sin is not covered by the
      mercy of God, it cannot be denied before men; there are many who,
      delighting in such talk, glory to make their vices known, whilst others
      who contradict themselves in this way become their own accusers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you know any such instance,&rdquo; said Saffredent, &ldquo;I give you my place and
      beg you to tell it us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen then,&rdquo; said Longarine.

      <i>TALE LXII</i>.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>A lady&rsquo;s tongue tripped so awkwardly whilst she was telling
     a story, as if of another, to a dame of high degree, that
     her honour thenceforward bore a stain which she could never
     remove</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      In the time of King Francis the First there lived a lady of the blood
      royal, who was endowed with honour, virtue and beauty, and well knew how
      to tell a story with grace and to laugh at such as might be told to her.
      (1) This lady being at one of her houses, all her subjects and neighbours
      came to see her; for she was as much liked as it were possible for woman
      to be.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  M. de Lincy thinks that this lady may be Louise of Savoy,
     who was very fond of listening to stories of an equivocal
     character. This, it may be pointed out, is one of the
     reasons why the commentators of the <i>Heptameron</i> suppose her
     to be Oisille, though the latter in the conversational
     passages following the tales displays considerable prudery
     and devoutness. That Louise was a woman of extremely amorous
     tendency is well known; we need, indeed, no better proof of
     it than her unseemly passion for the Constable de Bourbon
     when she was five-and-forty years of age. If she be the lady
     of royal blood spoken of above, the incidents of the tale
     may have occurred in the Bourbonnais, a considerable portion
     of which passed into her hands after the flight of the
     Constable from France. It will be noted that allusion is
     made to the lady&rsquo;s subjects, showing that she exercised a
     feudal sway. As one of the commentators of the <i>Heptameron</i>
     has pointed out, Queen Margaret always saw her mother&mdash;that
     &ldquo;donna terribilissima!&rdquo; as De Lussy called her&mdash;in such an
     ideal light that M. de Lincy&rsquo;s surmise may well be a correct
     one despite the attributes of honour, virtue and beauty
     bestowed on the lady whom she speaks of.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      Among others there came a lady who hearkened whilst the rest told every
      story they could think of in order to amuse the Princess. This lady then
      resolved that she would not be behind the others, and accordingly said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam, I will tell you a fine story, but you must promise me not to speak
      of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she forthwith continued&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The story, madam, is on my conscience a perfectly true one, and concerns
      a married lady who lived in all honour with her husband, although he was
      old and she was young. A gentleman who was her neighbour, seeing her
      married to this old man, fell in love with her, and importuned her for
      several years; but never received of her any reply save such as a virtuous
      woman should make. One day the gentleman bethought him that if he could
      take her at a disadvantage she might perchance be less harsh towards him,
      and, after he had for a long while weighed the danger that he might run,
      his love for the lady wholly banished his fears, and he resolved to find a
      time and place. He kept excellent watch, and so one morning, when the
      lady&rsquo;s husband was going to another of his houses, and leaving at daybreak
      by reason of the heat, the young gallant came to the house, where he found
      the lady asleep in her bed, and perceived that the serving-women were gone
      out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, without having sense enough to fasten the door, he got into the
      lady&rsquo;s bed all booted and spurred as he was, and when she awoke, she was
      as distressed as she could possibly be. But in spite of any remonstrance
      that she could make to him, he took her by force, saying that if she
      should make the matter known he would tell every one that she had sent for
      him; and at this the lady was so greatly afraid that she durst not cry
      out. Afterwards, on some of her women coming in, he rose in haste and
      would have been perceived by none if his spur, which had become fastened
      in the upper sheet, had not drawn it right off, leaving the lady quite
      naked in her bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So far the lady had told the story as if of another, but at the end she
      involuntarily said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never was a woman so confounded as I was, when I found myself lying quite
      naked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At these last words the lady, who had hitherto hearkened to the story
      without laughing, could not refrain from doing so, and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By what I can see, you are well qualified to tell the tale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The poor lady tried in every possible way to clear her honour, but it was
      already flown so far away that she was never able to recall it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you, ladies, that had she felt any deep displeasure in doing
      such a deed, she would have desired to forget it. But, as I have told you,
      sin will of itself be discovered before it could otherwise be known,
      unless it be hidden by the mantle which, as David says, makes man
      blessed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In good sooth,&rdquo; said Ennasuite, &ldquo;she was the greatest fool I have ever
      heard of, to make the others laugh at her own expense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not deem it strange,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;that the word should follow
      the deed, for it is easier to say than to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Geburon, &ldquo;what sin had she committed? She was asleep in her
      bed, he threatened her with shame and death; Lucrèce, who is so highly
      praised, did just the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;and I confess that there is none too
      righteous to fall. But when one has felt great offence in the deed, the
      same holds good of the recollection; and whereas Lucrèce to efface the
      latter killed herself, this foolish woman tried to make others laugh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; said Nomerfide, &ldquo;it seems that she was a virtuous woman,
      seeing that she had been many times entreated but would never consent, so
      that the gentleman must needs resort to treachery and force in order to
      wrong her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said Parlamente. &ldquo;Do you think that a woman has answered for her
      honour, when she gives herself up after refusing two or three times? There
      would then be many virtuous women among those that are deemed the
      opposite, for many of them have been known to refuse for a long while
      those to whom their hearts had been given, some doing this through fear
      for their honour, and others in order to make themselves still more
      ardently loved and esteemed. No account, therefore, should be made of a
      woman unless she stands firm to the end. But if a man refuse a beautiful
      girl, do you regard that as great virtue?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;if a young and lusty man so refused, I should hold
      it worthy of high praise, but none the less difficult of belief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet,&rdquo; said Dagoucin, &ldquo;I know one who refused to partake in amours that
      were sought after by all his comrades.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pray you,&rdquo; said Longarine, &ldquo;take my place and tell us the tale, yet
      remember that you must here utter the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promise you,&rdquo; said Dagoucin, &ldquo;that I will tell it in all its
      simplicity, without any colouring or disguise.&rdquo;

     <i>A gentleman&rsquo;s refusal of an amour that was sought after by
     all his comrades, was imputed to him as great virtue, and
     his wife loved him and esteemed him in consequence far more
     than before</i>. (1)
</pre>
    <p>
      In the city of Paris there lived four girls, of whom two were sisters, and
      such was their beauty, youth and freshness, that they were run after by
      all the gallants. A gentleman, however, who at that time held the office
      of Provost of Paris (2) from the King, seeing that his master was young,
      of an age to desire such company, so cleverly contrived matters with all
      four of the damsels that each, thinking herself intended for the King,
      agreed to what the aforesaid Provost desired. This was that they should
      all of them be present at a feast to which he invited his master.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  This story, omitted by Boaistuau, was included in
     Gruget&rsquo;s edition of the <i>Heptameron</i>.&mdash;L.

     2  This is John de la Barre, already alluded to in Tale I.
     The <i>Journal d&rsquo;un Bourgeois de Paris</i> tells us that he was
     born in Paris of poor parents, and became a favourite of
     Francis I., who appointed him Bailiff of the capital,
     without requiring him to pay any of the dues attaching to
     the office. From the roll of the royal household for 1522,
     we also find that he was then a gentleman of the bed chamber
     with 1200 <i>livres</i> salary, master of the wardrobe (a post
     worth 200 <i>livres</i>) and governor of the pages, for the board
     and clothing of whom he received 5000 <i>livres</i> annually. In
     1526 he became Provost as well as Bailiff of Paris, the two
     offices then being amalgamated. He was further created Count
     of Etampes, and acquired the lordship of Veretz, best
     remembered by its associations with the murder of Paul Louis
     Courier. La Barre fought at Pavia, was taken prisoner with
     the King, and remained his constant companion during his
     captivity. Several letters of his, dating from this period
     and of great historical interest, are still extant; some of
     them have been published by Champollion-Figeac (<i>Captivité
     de François Ier</i>) and Génin (<i>Lettres de Marguerite, &amp;c</i>).
     Under date 1533 (o. s.) the &ldquo;Bourgeois de Paris&rdquo; writes in
     his <i>Journal</i>: &ldquo;At the beginning of March there died in
     Paris, at the house of Monsieur Poncher, Monsieur le Prévost
     de Paris, named de La Barre.... The King was then in Paris,
     at his chateau of the Louvre, and there was great pomp at
     the obsequies; and he was borne to his lordship of Veretz,
     near Tours, that he might be buried there.&rdquo; Numerous
     particulars concerning La Barre will also be found in M. de
     Laborde&rsquo;s <i>Comptes des Bâtiments du Roi au XVIeme Siècle</i>.&mdash;
     L. and Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      He told the latter his plan, which was approved both by the Prince and by
      two other great personages of the Court, all three agreeing together to
      share in the spoil.
    </p>
    <p>
      While they were looking for a fourth comrade, there arrived a handsome and
      honourable lord who was ten years younger than the others. He was invited
      to the banquet, but although he accepted with a cheerful countenance, in
      his heart he had no desire for it. For on the one part he had a wife who
      was the mother of handsome children, and with whom he lived in great
      happiness, and in such peacefulness that on no account would he have had
      her suspect evil of him. And on the other hand he was the lover of one of
      the handsomest ladies of her time in France, whom he loved and esteemed so
      greatly that all other women seemed to him ugly beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his early youth, before he was married, he had found it impossible to
      gaze upon and associate with other women, however beautiful they might be;
      for he took more delight in gazing upon his sweetheart, and in perfectly
      loving her, than in having all that another might have given him.
    </p>
    <p>
      This lord, then, went to his wife and told her secretly of the enterprise
      that his master had in hand, saying that he would rather die than do what
      he had promised. For (he told her) just as there was no living man whom he
      would not venture to attack in anger, although he would rather die than
      commit a causeless and wilful murder unless his honour compelled him to
      it; even so, unless driven by extreme love, such as may serve to blind
      virtuous men, he would rather die than break his marriage vow to gratify
      another.
    </p>
    <p>
      On hearing these words of his, and finding that so much honour dwelt in
      one so young, his wife loved and esteemed him more than she had ever done
      before, and inquired how he thought he might best excuse himself, since
      Princes often frown on those who do not praise what they like.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have always heard,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;that a wise man has a journey or a
      sickness in his sleeve for use in time of need. I have therefore resolved
      that I will feign a grievous sickness four or five days beforehand, and in
      this matter your countenance may render me true service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tis a worthy and holy hypocrisy,&rdquo; said his wife, &ldquo;and I will not fail to
      serve you with the saddest face I can command; for he who can avoid
      offending God and angering the Prince is fortunate indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As it was resolved, so was it done, and the King was very sorry to hear
      from the wife of her husband&rsquo;s sickness. This, however, lasted no long
      time; for, on account of certain business which arose, the King
      disregarded his pleasure to attend to his duty, and betook himself away
      from Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, one day, remembering their unfinished undertaking, he said to the
      young lord:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were very foolish to leave so suddenly without seeing the four girls
      who are declared to be the fairest in my kingdom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very glad,&rdquo; replied the young lord, &ldquo;that you failed in the matter,
      for I was in great fear that, by reason of my sickness, I should be the
      only one to miss so pleasant an adventure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By reason of this answer the King never suspected the dissimulation of the
      young lord, who was thenceforward loved by his wife more dearly than he
      had ever been before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hereupon Parlamente began to laugh, and could not hold from saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He would have loved his wife better if he had done this for love of her
      alone. But in any case he is worthy of great praise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;that it is no great merit in a man to keep
      his chastity for love of his wife, inasmuch as there are many reasons
      which in a manner compel him to do so. In the first place, God commands
      it; his marriage vow binds him to it, and, further, surfeited nature is
      not liable to temptation or desire as necessity is. But when the
      unfettered love that a man bears towards a mistress of whom he has no
      delight, and no other happiness save that of seeing her and speaking with
      her, and from whom he often receives harsh replies&mdash;when this love is
      so loyal and steadfast that nothing can ever make it change, I say that
      such chastity is not simply praiseworthy but miraculous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis no miracle in my opinion,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;for when the heart is
      plighted, nothing is impossible to the body.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Hircan; &ldquo;to bodies which have become those of angels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not speak only of those,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;who by the grace of God are
      wholly transformed into Himself, but of the grosser spirits that we see
      here below among men. And, if you give heed, you will find that those who
      have set their hearts and affections upon seeking after the perfection of
      the sciences, have forgotten not only the lust of the flesh, but even the
      most needful matters, such as food and drink; for so long as the soul is
      stirred within the body, so long does the flesh continue as though
      insensible. Thence comes it that those who love handsome, honourable and
      virtuous women have such happiness of spirit in seeing them and speaking
      with them, that the flesh is lulled in all its desires. Those who cannot
      feel this happiness are the carnally-minded, who, wrapped in their
      exceeding fatness, cannot tell whether they have a soul or not. But, when
      the body is in subjection to the spirit, it is as though heedless of the
      failings of the flesh, and the beliefs of such persons may render them
      insensible of the same. I knew a gentleman who, to show that he loved his
      mistress more dearly than did any other man, proved it to all his comrades
      by holding his bare fingers in the flame of a candle. And then, with his
      eyes fixed upon his mistress, he remained firm until he had burned himself
      to the bone, and yet said that he had felt no hurt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Methinks,&rdquo; said Geburon, &ldquo;that the devil whose martyr he was ought to
      have made a St. Lawrence of him; for there are few whose love-flame is hot
      enough to keep them from fearing that of the smallest taper. But if a lady
      had suffered me to endure so much hurt for her sake, I should either have
      sought a rich reward or else have taken my love away from her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;you would have your hour after the lady had had
      hers? That was what was done by a gentleman of the neighbourhood of
      Valencia in Spain, whose story was told to me by a captain, a right worthy
      man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pray you, madam,&rdquo; said Dagoucin, &ldquo;take my place and tell it us, for I
      am sure that it must be a good one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This story, ladies,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;will teach you both to think twice
      when you are inclined to give a refusal and to lay aside the thought that
      the present will always continue; and so, knowing that it is subject to
      mutation, you will have a care for the time to come.&rdquo;

      <i>TALE LXIV</i>.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>After a lady had for the space of five or six years made
     trial of the love that a certain gentleman bore her, she
     desired to have a still stronger proof of it, and reduced
     him to such despair that he turned monk, on which account
     she was not able to win him back again when she would fain
     have done so</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      In the city of Valencia there lived a gentleman, who for the space of five
      or six years had loved a lady so perfectly that the honour and conscience
      of neither of them had taken any hurt; for his intent was to have her as
      his wife, and this was reasonable, seeing that he was handsome, rich and
      of good descent. But, before he became her lover, he first inquired
      concerning her own mind, whereupon she declared herself willing to marry
      according to the counsels of her kinsfolk. The latter, being come together
      for the purpose, deemed the marriage a very reasonable one provided that
      the maiden was herself disposed to it; but she&mdash;whether because she
      thought to do better or because she wished to hide her love for him&mdash;-made
      some difficulty, and the company separated, not without regret at having
      failed to conclude a match so well suited to both parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most grieved of all was the poor gentleman, who would have borne his
      misfortune with patience had he thought that the fault lay with the
      kinsfolk and not with her; but he knew the truth, and the knowledge was to
      him worse than death. So, without speaking to his sweetheart or to any
      other person, he withdrew to his own house, and, after setting his affairs
      in order, betook himself to a solitary spot, where he strove to forget his
      love and change it wholly to that love of our Lord which were truly a
      higher duty than the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this time he received no tidings of his mistress or her kindred,
      and he therefore resolved that, since he had failed to obtain the happiest
      life he could hope for, he would choose the most austere and disagreeable
      that he could imagine. With this sad intent, which might well have been
      called despair, he went and became a monk in the monastery of St. Francis.
      This monastery was not far from the dwellings of divers of his kinsfolk,
      who, on hearing of his desperate condition, did all that in them lay to
      hinder his purpose; but this was so firmly rooted in his heart that it was
      not possible to turn him from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, as the source of his distemper was known to them, they
      determined to seek the cure, and so repaired to her who was the cause of
      his sudden devoutness. She was greatly astonished and grieved by this
      mischance, for, in refusing for a time, she had thought only to test his
      affection, not to lose it for ever. Seeing now the evident risk that she
      ran of doing this last, she sent him a letter, which, ill-translated, was
      as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Since love, if tested not full needfully,
     Steadfast and faithful is not shown to be,
     By length of time my heart would that assay
     Whereon itself was set to love alway&mdash;
     To wit, a husband with that true love filled
     Such as no lapsing time has ever killed.
     This, then, was the sole reason that I drew
     My kin to hinder for a year or two
     That closest tie which lasts till life is not,
     And whereby woe is oftentimes begot.
     Yet sought I not to have you wholly sent
     Away; such was in no wise my intent,
     For none save you could I have e&rsquo;er adored
     Or looked to as my husband and my lord.
     But woe is me, what tidings reach mine ear!
     That you, to lead the cloistered life austere,
     Are gone with speech to none; whereat the pain
     That ever holds me, now can brook no rein,
     But forces me mine own estate to slight
     For that which yours aforetime was of right;
     To seek him out who once sought me alone,
     And win him who myself has sometimes won.
     Nay then, my love, life of the life in me,
     For loss of whom I fain would cease to be,
     Turn hither, graciously, those eyes of pain
     And trace those wandering footsteps back again.
     Leave the grey robe and its austerity,
     Come back and taste of that felicity
     Which often you desired, and which to-day
     Time has nor slain, nor swept away.
     For you alone I&rsquo;ve kept myself; and I,
     Lacking your presence, cannot choose but die.
     Come back then; in your sweetheart have belief,
     And for past memories find cool relief
     In holy marriage-ties. Ah! then, my dear,
     To me, not to your pride give ready ear,
     And rest of this assured, I had no thought
     To give, sweetheart, to you offence in aught,
     But only yearned your faithfulness to prove
     And then to make you happy with my love.
     But now that through this trial, free from scathe,
     Are come your steadfastness and patient faith,
     And all that loyal love to me is known,
     Which at the last has made me yours alone,
     Come, my beloved, take what is your due
     And wholly yield to me, as I to you!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This letter, brought by a friend of hers with every remonstrance that it
      was possible to make, was received and read by the gentleman friar with
      such sadness of countenance, such sighs and such tears, that it seemed as
      though he would drown and burn the poor epistle. But he made no reply to
      it, except to tell the messenger that the mortification of his exceeding
      passion had cost him so dear as to have taken from him both the wish to
      live and the fear to die. He therefore requested her who had been the
      cause of this, that since she had not chosen to satisfy his passionate
      longings, she would, now that he was rid of them, abstain from tormenting
      him, and rest content with the evil which was past. For that evil he could
      find no remedy but the choice of an austere life, which by continual
      penance might bring him to forget his grief, and, by fasts and
      disciplines, subdue his body, till the thought of death should be to him
      but a sovereign consolation. Above all, he begged that he might never hear
      of her, since he found the mere remembrance of her name a purgatory not to
      be endured.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman went back with this mournful reply, and reported it to the
      maiden who did not hear it without intolerable sorrow. But Love, which
      will not suffer the spirit utterly to fail, gave her the thought that, if
      she could see him, her words and presence might be of more effect than the
      writing. She therefore, with her father and the nearest of her kin, went
      to the monastery where he abode. She had left nothing in her box that
      might set off her beauty, for she felt sure that, could he but once look
      at her and hear her, the fire that had so long dwelt in both their hearts
      must of necessity be kindled again in greater strength than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coming thus into the monastery towards the end of vespers, she sent for
      him to come to her in a chapel that was in the cloister. He, knowing not
      who it was that sought him, went in all ignorance to the sternest battle
      in which he had ever been. When she saw him so pale and wan that she could
      hardly recognise him, yet filled with grace, in no whit less winning than
      of yore, Love made her stretch out her arms to embrace him, whilst her
      pity at seeing him in such a plight so enfeebled her heart, that she sank
      swooning to the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor monk, who was not void of brotherly charity, lifted her up and
      set her upon a seat in the chapel. Although he had no less need of aid
      than she had, he feigned to be unaware of her passion, and so strengthened
      his heart in the love of God against the opportunities now present with
      him, that, judging by his countenance, he seemed not to know what was
      actually before him. Having recovered from her weakness, she turned upon
      him her beautiful, piteous eyes, which were enough to soften a rock, and
      began to utter all such discourse as she believed apt to draw him from the
      place in which he now was. He replied as virtuously as he was able; but at
      last, finding that his heart was being softened by his sweetheart&rsquo;s
      abundant tears, and perceiving that Love, the cruel archer whose pains he
      long had known, was ready with his golden dart to deal him fresh and more
      deadly wounds, he fled both from Love and from his sweetheart, like one
      whose only resource lay, indeed, in flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was shut up in his room, not desiring to let her go without some
      settlement of the matter, he wrote her a few words in Spanish, which seem
      to me so excellent in their matter that I would not by translating them
      mar their grace. These were brought to her by a little novice, who found
      her still in the chapel and in such despair that, had it been lawful, she
      too would have remained there and turned friar. But when she saw the
      words, which were these&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Volvete don venesti, anima mia,
     Que en las tristas vidas es la mia,&rdquo; (1)
</pre>
    <p>
      she knew that all hope was gone, and she resolved to follow the advice of
      him and her friends, and so returned home, there to lead a life as
      melancholy as that of her lover in his monastery was austere.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  &ldquo;Return whence thou earnest, my soul,
     for among the sad lives is mine.&rdquo;&rsquo;
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, ladies, what vengeance the gentleman took upon his harsh
      sweetheart, who, thinking to try him, reduced him to such despair that,
      when she would have regained him, she could not do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; said Nomerfide, &ldquo;that he did not lay aside his gown and
      marry her. It would, I think, have been a perfect marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In good sooth,&rdquo; said Simontault, &ldquo;I think he was very wise. Anyone who
      well considers what marriage is will deem it no less grievous than a
      monkish life. Moreover, being so greatly weakened by fasts and abstinence,
      he feared to take upon him a burden of that kind which lasts all through
      life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Methinks,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;she wronged so feeble a man by tempting him to
      marriage, for &lsquo;tis too much for the strongest man alive; but had she
      spoken to him of love, free from any obligation but that of the will,
      there is no friar&rsquo;s cord that would not have been untied. However, since
      she sought to draw him out of purgatory by offering him hell, I think that
      he was quite right to refuse her, and to let her feel the pain that her
      own refusal had cost him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By my word,&rdquo; said Ennasuite, &ldquo;there are many who, thinking to do better
      than their fellows, do either worse or else the very opposite of what they
      desire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; said Geburon, &ldquo;you remind me&mdash;though, indeed, the matter is
      not greatly to the point&mdash;of a woman who did the opposite of what she
      desired, and so caused a great uproar in the church of St. John of Lyons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pray you,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;take my place and tell us about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My story,&rdquo; said Geburon, &ldquo;will not be so long or so piteous as the one we
      have heard from Parlamente.&rdquo;

     <i>Though the priests of St. John of Lyons would fain have
     concealed it, the falsity of a miracle was brought to light
     through an old woman&rsquo;s folly becoming known</i>. (1)
</pre>
    <p>
      In the church of St. John of Lyons there is a very dark chapel, and inside
      it a stone tomb with figures of great personages raised life-like upon it,
      whilst several men-at-arms lie all around it.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  We believe that the incident here narrated occurred early
     in 1525, when Margaret is known to have been at Lyons. She
     and her husband (on his return from Pavia) resided there at
     the house of the Obédiencier de St. Just, and it was in the
     church of St. Just that the Duke of Alençon was buried.
     Doubtless it was during his illness that the <i>novena</i>
     alluded to in the final tale of the <i>Heptameron</i> was
     performed by Queen Margaret at the church of St. John of
     Lyons, where the two most important chapels, according to
     Quincarnon&rsquo;s <i>Antiquités et la fondation de la Métropole
     des Gaules, &amp;c.</i>, Lyons, 1673, were the Most Holy Eucharist,
     or Bourbon chapel, built in 1449 by Charles de Bourbon,
     Primate of Gaul, and the Holy Sepulchre, or Good Friday
     chapel, erected at the beginning of the fifteenth century by
     Philip de Turey, Archbishop of Lyons. Unfortunately the
     church of St. John was in 1652 devastated by the Huguenots,
     who in their insensate fury destroyed almost all the tombs.
     It is therefore now impossible to identify the chapel and
     tomb to which the Queen of Navarre refers in the above
     story, though her allusion to the dimness of the light would
     incline us to place the incident she recounts in the
     Chapelle du St. Sépulcre.&mdash;L. and Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      One day a soldier, walking in the church at the very height of summer,
      felt inclined to sleep, and, looking at this dark, cool chapel, resolved
      to go and guard the tomb in sleep like the rest; (2) and accordingly he
      lay down beside them. Now it chanced that a very pious old woman came in
      while his sleep was the soundest, and having performed her devotions,
      holding a lighted taper in her hand, she sought to fix this taper to the
      tomb. Finding that the sleeping man was nearest to her, she tried to set
      it upon his forehead, thinking that it was of stone; but the wax would not
      stick to such stone as this, whereupon the worthy dame, believing that the
      reason of it was the coldness of the statue, applied the flame to the
      sleeper&rsquo;s forehead, that she might the better fix the taper on it. At
      this, however, the statue, which was not without feeling, began to cry
      out.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     2  Meaning the recumbent statues of the men-at-arms.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      The good woman was then in exceeding fear, and set herself to shout, &ldquo;A
      miracle! a miracle!&rdquo; until all who were in the church ran, some to ring
      the bells, and the rest to view the miracle. The good woman forthwith took
      them to see the statue that had stirred, whereupon many found food for
      laughter; though the greater number were unable to feel any content,
      inasmuch as they had really determined to make profit out of the tomb, and
      to gain as much money by it as by the crucifix on their pulpit, which is
      said to have spoken. (3) But when the woman&rsquo;s folly became known the farce
      came to an end. If all knew of their follies, they would not be accounted
      holy nor their miracles true. And I would beg you, ladies, to see
      henceforward to what saints you offer your candles. (4)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     3  The crucifix in the church of St. John was mainly of
     silver, and, according to Quincarnon, at the time of a
     Huguenot outbreak at Lyons it was thrown to the ground by a
     Calvinist minister named Ruffy, who, after reducing it to
     fragments, carried all the precious metal away with him.&mdash;M.

     4  The latter portion of this story and all the dialogue
     that follows it are omitted by Boaistuau in his edition.
     Gruget inserted the dialogue, but he did not dare to print
     the passage respecting the talking crucifix.&mdash;L.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis notable,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;that, whatever the matter in question may
      be, women always do wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it wrong,&rdquo; asked Nomerfide, &ldquo;to bring candles to a tomb?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;if the flame be turned against a man&rsquo;s forehead; for
      nothing good should be called good if it be attended with evil. You may be
      sure that the poor woman thought she had made a fine gift to God with her
      little candle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I look not to the gift,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;but to the heart that offers it.
      Perhaps this worthy woman had more love for God than those who offer great
      torches; for, as the Gospel says, she gave of her need.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still, I no not believe,&rdquo; said Saffredent, &ldquo;that God, who is sovereign
      wisdom, can be pleased with the foolishness of women. Although simplicity
      is pleasing to Him, I see from the Scriptures that He despises the
      ignorant; and if He commands us to be as harmless as the dove, He none the
      less commands us to be wise like the serpent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my part,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;I do not call the woman ignorant who brings
      her candle or burning taper into the presence of God, and makes amends for
      her wrongdoing on bended knees before her sovereign Lord, confessing her
      unworthiness and with steadfast hope seeking pity and salvation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would to God,&rdquo; said Dagoucin, &ldquo;that all understood it in the same way as
      you; but I do not believe that these poor fools do it with the intent you
      say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The women,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;who are least able to speak are just those who
      are most sensible of the love and will of God; wherefore &lsquo;tis well to
      judge none but ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ennasuite laughed and said&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;Tis no wonderful thing to have
      frightened a sleeping varlet, since women of as lowly condition have
      frightened noble Princes, without putting fire to their foreheads.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure,&rdquo; said Geburon, &ldquo;that you know some such story, which you are
      willing to relate; wherefore, if it please you, you shall take my place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The tale will not be a long one,&rdquo; said Ennasuite, &ldquo;but, could I recount
      it just as it happened, you would have no desire to weep.&rdquo;

      <i>TALE LXVI</i>.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>The Duke of Vendôme and the Princess of Navarre, whilst
     resting together one afternoon, were surprised by an old
     serving-woman, who took them for a prothonotary and a damsel
     between whom she suspected some affection; and, through this
     fine justicement, a matter, of which intimates were
     ignorant, was made known to strangers</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      In the year when the Duke of Vendôme married the Princess of Navarre, (1)
      the King and Queen, their parents, after feasting at Vendôme, went with
      them into Guienne, and, visiting a gentleman&rsquo;s house where there were many
      honourable and beautiful ladies, the newly married pair danced so long in
      this excellent company that they became weary, and, withdrawing to their
      chamber, lay down in their clothes upon the bed and fell asleep, doors and
      windows being shut and none remaining with them.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  It was in October 1548, some eighteen months after Henry
     II. had succeeded Francis I., that Anthony de Bourbon, Duke
     of Vendôme, who after the King&rsquo;s children held the first
     rank in France, was married at Moulins to Margaret&rsquo;s
     daughter Jane of Navarre. The Duke was then thirty and Jane
     twenty years old. &ldquo;I never saw so joyous a bride,&rdquo; wrote
     Henry II. to Montmorency, &ldquo;she never does anything but
     laugh.&rdquo; She was indeed well pleased with the match, the
     better so, perhaps, as her husband had settled 100,000
     livres on her, a gift which was the more acceptable by
     reason of her extravagant tastes and love of display. Ste.
     Marthe, in his <i>Oraison Funèbre</i> on Queen Margaret, speaks
     of her daughter&rsquo;s marriage as &ldquo;a most fortunate
     conjunction,&rdquo; and refers to her son-in-law as &ldquo;the most
     valiant and magnanimous Prince Anthony, Duke of Vendôme,
     whose admirable virtues have so inclined all France to love
     and revere him, that princes and nobles, the populace, the
     great and the humble alike, no sooner hear his name
     mentioned than they forthwith wish him and beg God to bestow
     on him all possible health and prosperity.&rdquo;&mdash;Ed
</pre>
    <p>
      Just, however, when their sleep was at its soundest, they were awakened by
      their door being opened from without, and the Duke drew the curtain and
      looked to see who it might be, suspecting indeed that it was one of his
      friends who was minded to surprise him. But he perceived a tall, old
      bed-chamber woman come in and walk straight up to their bed, where, for
      the darkness of the room, she could not recognise them. Seeing them,
      however, quite close together, she began to cry out&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou vile and naughty wanton! I have long suspected thee to be what thou
      art, yet for lack of proof spoke not of it to my mistress. But now thy
      vileness is so clearly shown that I shall in no sort conceal it; and thou,
      foul renegade, who hast wrought such shame in this house by the undoing of
      this poor wench, if it were not for the fear of God, I would e&rsquo;en cudgel
      thee where thou liest. Get up, in the devil&rsquo;s name, get up, for methinks
      even now thou hast no shame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Duke of Vendôme and the Princess hid their faces against each other in
      order to have the talk last longer, and they laughed so heartily that they
      were not able to utter a word. Finding that for all her threats they were
      not willing to rise, the serving-woman came closer in order to pull them
      by the arms. Then she at once perceived both from their faces and from
      their dress that they were not those whom she sought, and, recognising
      them, she flung herself upon her knees, begging them to pardon her error
      in thus robbing them of their rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Duke of Vendôme was not content to know so little, and rising
      forthwith, he begged the old woman to say for whom she had taken them.
      This at first she was not willing to do; but at last, after he had sworn
      to her never to reveal it, she told him that there was a girl in the house
      with whom a prothonotary (2) was in love, and that she had long kept a
      watch on them, since it pleased her little to see her mistress trusting in
      a man who was working this shame towards her. She then left the Prince and
      Princess shut in as she had found them, and they laughed for a long while
      over their adventure. And, although they afterwards told the story they
      would never name any of the persons concerned.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     2  The office of apostolic prothonotary was instituted by
     Pope Clement I., there being at first twelve such officers,
     whose duty was to write the lives of the saints and other
     apostolic records. Gradually their number so increased, that
     in the fifteenth century the title of prothonotary had come
     to be merely an honorary dignity, conferred as a matter of
     course on doctors of theology of noble family, or otherwise
     of note. In the role of Francis I.&lsquo;s household for 1522, we
     find but one prothonotary mentioned, but in that for 1529
     there are twelve. More than one of them might have been
     called <i>un letrado que no tenia muchas letras</i>, as Brantôme
     wrote of Thomas de Lescun, Prothonotary of Foix and
     afterwards Marshal of France. &ldquo;In those days,&rdquo; adds the
     author of <i>Les Grands Capitaines Français</i>, &ldquo;it was usual
     for prothonotaries and even for those of good family not to
     have much learning, but to enjoy themselves, hunt, make love
     and seduce the wives of the poor gentlemen who were gone to
     the wars.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>OEuvres complètes de Brantôme</i>, 8vo edit., vol.
     ii. p. 144.&mdash;L. and Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, ladies, how the worthy dame, whilst thinking to do a fine deed
      of justice, made known to strange princes a matter of which the servants
      of the house had never heard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I know,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;in whose house it was, and who the
      prothonotary is; for he has governed many a lady&rsquo;s house, and when he
      cannot win the mistress&rsquo;s favour he never fails to have that of one of the
      maids. In other matters, however, he is an honourable and worthy man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you say &lsquo;in other matters&rsquo;?&rdquo; said Hircan. &ldquo;Tis for that very
      behaviour that I deem him so worthy a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can see,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;that you know the sickness and the
      sufferer, and that, if he needed excuse, you would not fail him as
      advocate. Yet I would not trust myself to a man who could not contrive his
      affairs without having them known to the serving-women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you imagine,&rdquo; said Nomerfide, &ldquo;that men care whether such a matter
      be known if only they can compass their end? You may be sure that, even if
      none spoke of it but themselves, it would still of necessity be known.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have no need,&rdquo; said Hircan angrily, &ldquo;to say all that they know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; she replied, blushing, &ldquo;they would not say it to their own
      advantage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judging from your words,&rdquo; said Simontault, &ldquo;it would seem that men
      delight in hearing evil spoken about women, and I am sure that you reckon
      me among men of that kind. I therefore greatly wish to speak well of one
      of your sex, in order that I may not be held a slanderer by all the rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I give you my place,&rdquo; said Ennasuite, &ldquo;praying you withal to control your
      natural disposition, so that you may acquit yourself worthily in our
      honour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Forthwith Simontault began&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tis no new thing, ladies, to hear of some virtuous act on your part
      which, methinks, should not be hidden but rather written in letters of
      gold, that it may serve women as an example, and give men cause for
      admiration at seeing in the weaker sex that from which weakness is prone
      to shrink. I am prompted, therefore, to relate something that I heard from
      Captain Robertval and divers of his company.&rdquo;

     husband, whom she forsook not until death</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      The Captain Robertval aforesaid once made a voyage across the seas to the
      island of Canadas, (1) himself being chief in command by the appointment
      of the King, his master. And there, if the air of the country were good,
      he had resolved to dwell and to build towns and castles. With this work he
      made such a beginning as is known to all; and to people the country with
      Christians he took with him all kinds of artificers, among whom was a most
      wicked man, who betrayed his master and put him in danger of being
      captured by the natives. But God willed that his attempt should be
      discovered before any evil befell the Captain, who, seizing the wicked
      traitor, was minded to punish him as he deserved. And this he would have
      done but for the man&rsquo;s wife, who had followed her husband through the
      perils of the deep and would not now leave him to die, but with many tears
      so wrought upon the Captain and all his company that, for pity of her and
      for the sake of the services she had done them, her request was granted.
      In consequence, husband and wife were left together on a small island in
      the sea, inhabited only by wild beasts, and were suffered to take with
      them such things as were needful.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  Canada had been discovered by Cabot in 1497; and in 1535
     James Cartier sailed up the St. Lawrence and, taking
     possession of the country in the name of Francis I., called
     it La Nouvelle France. Seven years later a gentleman of
     Picardy, named John Francis de La Roque, Lord of Robertval,
     accompanying Cartier, established a colony on the Isle
     Royale, and subsequently built the fort of Charlebourg. One
     of his pilots, named Alphonse of Saintonge, meanwhile
     reconnoitred the coasts both of Canada and Labrador. About
     this time (1542) the incidents related in the above tale
     must have occurred.&mdash;L.
</pre>
    <p>
      The poor folk, finding themselves all alone and surrounded by wild and
      cruel beasts, had no recourse but to God, who had ever been this poor
      woman&rsquo;s steadfast hope; and, since she found all her consolation in Him,
      she carried the New Testament with her for safeguard, nourishment and
      consolation, and in it read unceasingly. Further, she laboured with her
      husband to make them a little dwelling as best they might, and when the
      lions (2) and other animals came near to devour them, the husband with his
      arquebuss and she with stones made so stout a defence that not only were
      the beasts afraid to approach, but often some were slain that were very
      good for food. And on this flesh and the herbs of the land, they lived for
      some time after their bread failed them.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     2  This mention of lions on a small desert island in the
     Canadian seas would be rather perplexing did we not know how
     great at that time was the general ignorance on most matters
     connected with natural history. Possibly the allusion may be
     to the <i>lion marin</i>, as the French call the leonine seal.
     This, however, is anything but an aggressive animal.
     Curiously enough, Florimond de Rémond, the sixteenth century
     writer, speaks of a drawing of a &ldquo;marine lion&rdquo; given to him
     &ldquo;by that most illustrious lady Margaret Queen of Navarre, to
     whom it had been presented by a Spanish gentleman, who was
     taking a second copy of it to the Emperor Charles V., then
     in Spain.&rdquo;&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      At last, however, the husband could no longer endure this nutriment, and
      by reason of the waters that they drank became so swollen that in a short
      while he died, and this without any service or consolation save from his
      wife, she being both his doctor and his confessor; and when he had
      joyously passed out of the desert into the heavenly country, the poor
      woman, left now in solitude, buried him in the earth as deeply as she was
      able. Nevertheless the beasts quickly knew of it, and came to eat the dead
      body; but the poor woman, firing with the arquebuss from her cabin, saved
      her husband&rsquo;s flesh from finding such a grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leading thus in regard to her body the life of a brute, and in regard to
      her soul the life of an angel, she passed her time in reading,
      meditations, prayers and orisons, having a glad and happy mind in a wasted
      and half-dead body. But He who never forsakes His own, and who manifests
      His power when others are in despair, did not suffer the virtue that he
      had put into this woman to be unknown by men, but willed that it should be
      made manifest to His own glory. He therefore brought things so to pass,
      that after some time, when one of the ships of the armament was passing by
      the island, those that were looking that way perceived some smoke, which
      reminded them of the persons who had been left there, and they resolved to
      go and see what God had done with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor woman, seeing the ship draw nigh, dragged herself to the shore,
      and there they found her on their arrival. After giving praise to God, she
      brought them to her poor cottage and showed them on what she had lived
      during her abode in that place. This would have seemed to them impossible
      of belief, but for their knowledge that God is as powerful to feed His
      servants in a desert as at the greatest banquet in the world. As the poor
      woman could not continue in such a spot, they took her with them straight
      to La Rochelle, where, their voyage ended, they arrived. And when they had
      made known to the inhabitants the faithfulness and endurance of this
      woman, she was very honourably received by all the ladies, who gladly sent
      their daughters to her to learn to read and write. In this honest calling
      she maintained herself for the rest of her life, having no other desire
      save to admonish every one to love and trust Our Lord, and setting forth
      as an example the great compassion that He had shown towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, ladies, you cannot say I do not praise the virtues which God has
      given you, and which show the more when possessed by one of lowly
      condition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, we are not sorry,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;to hear you praise the mercies of
      Our Lord, for in truth all virtue comes from Him; but we must confess that
      man assists in the work of God as little as women. Neither can by heart or
      will do more than plant. God alone giveth the increase.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you have studied Scripture,&rdquo; said Saffredent, &ldquo;you know that St. Paul
      says that Apollos planted and he himself watered; (3) but he does not
      speak of women as having set hand to the work of God.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     3  The text is just the contrary: &ldquo;I have planted, Apollos
     watered; but God gave the increase.&rdquo;&mdash;I <i>Corinthians</i> iii.
     6.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would follow,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;the opinion of those wicked men who
      take a passage of Scripture that is in their favour and leave one that is
      against them. If you had read St. Paul to the end, you would have found
      that he commends himself to the ladies, who greatly laboured with him in
      the work of the Gospel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However that may be,&rdquo; said Longarine, &ldquo;the woman in the story is well
      worthy of praise both for the love she bore her husband, on whose behalf
      she risked her own life, and for the faith she had in God, who, as we see,
      did not forsake her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Ennasuite, &ldquo;as far as the first is concerned, that there
      is no woman present but would do as much to save her husband&rsquo;s life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;that some husbands are such brutes that the
      women who live with them should not find it strange to live among their
      fellows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ennasuite, who took these words to herself, could not refrain from saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Provided the beasts did not bite me, their company would be more pleasant
      to me than that of men, who are choleric and intolerable. But I abide by
      what I have said, that, if my husband were in a like danger, I should not
      leave him to die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beware,&rdquo; said Nomerfide, &ldquo;of loving too fondly, for excess of love will
      deceive both him and you. There is a medium in all things, and through
      lack of knowledge love often gives birth to hate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Methinks,&rdquo; said Simontault, &ldquo;you have not carried your discourse so far
      without having an instance to confirm it. If, then, you know such a one, I
      give you my place that you may tell it to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Nomerfide, &ldquo;the tale shall, as is my wont, be a short and a
      merry one.&rdquo;

      <i>TALE LXVIII</i>.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>An apothecary&rsquo;s wife, finding that her husband made no
     great account of her, and wishing to be better loved by him,
     followed the advice that he had given to a &ldquo;commère&rdquo; (1) of
     his, whose sickness was of the same kind as her own; but she
     prospered not so well as the other, and instead of love
     reaped hate</i>.

     1  Mr W. Kelly has pointed out (Bohn&rsquo;s <i>Heptameron</i>, p. 395)
     that in France the godfather and godmother of a child are
     called in reference to each other compère and commère, terms
     implying mutual relations of an extremely friendly kind. &ldquo;The
     same usage exists in all Catholic countries,&rdquo; adds Mr Kelly,
     &ldquo;and one of the novels of the <i>Decameron</i> is founded on a
     very general opinion in Italy that an amorous connection
     between a <i>compadre</i> and his <i>commadre</i> partook almost of
     the nature of incest.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      In the town of Pau in Beam there was an apothecary whom men called Master
      Stephen. He had married a virtuous wife and a thrifty, with beauty enough
      to content him. But just as he was wont to taste different drugs, so did
      he also with women, that he might be the better able to speak of all
      kinds. His wife was greatly tormented by this, and at last lost all
      patience; for he made no account of her except by way of penance during
      Holy Week.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day when the apothecary was in his shop, and his wife had hidden
      herself behind him to listen to what he might say, a woman, who was
      &ldquo;commère&rdquo; to the apothecary, and was stricken with the same sickness as
      his own wife, came in, and, sighing, said to him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, good godfather, I am the most unhappy woman alive. I love my
      husband better than myself, and do nothing but think of how I may serve
      and obey him; but all my labour is wasted, for he prefers the wickedest,
      foulest, vilest woman in the town to me. So, godfather, if you know of any
      drug that will change his humour, prithee give it me, and, if I be well
      treated by him, I promise to reward you by all means in my power.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The apothecary, to comfort her, said that he knew of a powder which, if
      she gave it to her husband with his broth or roast, after the fashion of
      Duke&rsquo;s powder, (2) would induce him to entertain her in the best possible
      manner. The poor woman, wishing to behold this miracle, asked him what the
      powder was, and whether she could have some of it. He declared that there
      was nothing like powder of cantharides, of which he had a goodly store;
      and before they parted she made him prepare this powder, and took as much
      of it as was needful for her purpose. And afterwards she often thanked the
      apothecary, for her husband, who was strong and lusty, and did not take
      too much, was none the worse for it.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     2  Boaistuau and Gruget call this preparation <i>poudre de
     Dun</i>, as enigmatical an appellation as <i>poudre de Duc</i>. As
     for the specific supplied by the apothecary, the context
     shows that this was the same aphrodisiac as the Marquis de
     Sades put to such a detestable use at Marseilles in 1772,
     when, after fleeing from justice, he was formally sentenced
     to death, and broken, in effigy, upon the wheel. See P.
     Lacroix&rsquo;s <i>Curiosités de l&rsquo;histoire de France, IIème Série</i>,
     Paris, 1858.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      The apothecary&rsquo;s wife heard all this talk, and thought within herself that
      she had no less need of the recipe than her husband&rsquo;s &ldquo;commère.&rdquo;
       Observing, therefore, the place where her husband put the remainder of the
      powder, she resolved that she would use some of it when she found an
      opportunity; and this she did within three or four days. Her husband, who
      felt a coldness of the stomach, begged her to make him some good soup, but
      she replied that a roast with Duke&rsquo;s powder would be better for him;
      whereupon he bade her go quickly and prepare it, and take cinnamon and
      sugar from the shop. This she did, not forgetting also to take the
      remainder of the powder given to the &ldquo;commère,&rdquo; without any heed to dose,
      weight or measure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The husband ate the roast, and thought it very good. Before long, however,
      he felt its effects, and sought to soothe them with his wife, but this he
      found was impossible, for he felt all on fire, in such wise that he knew
      not which way to turn. He then told his wife that she had poisoned him,
      and demanded to know what she had put into the roast. She forthwith
      confessed the truth, telling him that she herself required the recipe
      quite as much as his &ldquo;commère.&rdquo; By reason of his evil plight, the poor
      apothecary could belabour her only with hard words; however, he drove her
      from his presence, and sent to beg the Queen of Navarre&rsquo;s apothecary (3)
      to come and see him. This the Queen&rsquo;s apothecary did, and whilst giving
      the other all the remedies proper for his cure (which in a short time was
      effected) he rebuked him very sharply for his folly in counselling another
      to use drugs that he was not willing to take himself, and declared that
      his wife had only done her duty, inasmuch as she had desired to be loved
      by her husband.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     3  It was from her apothecary no doubt that Queen Margaret
     heard this story.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      Thus the poor man was forced to endure the results of his folly in
      patience, and to own that he had been justly punished in being brought
      into such derision as he had proposed for another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Methinks, ladies, this woman&rsquo;s love was as indiscreet as it was great.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you call it loving her husband,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;to give him pain for
      the sake of the delight that she herself looked to have?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; said Longarine, &ldquo;she only desired to win back her husband&rsquo;s
      love, which she deemed to have gone far astray; and for the sake of such
      happiness there is nothing that a woman will not do.&rdquo; &ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; said
      Geburon, &ldquo;a woman ought on no account to make her husband eat or drink
      anything unless, either through her own experience or that of learned
      folk, she be sure that it can do him no harm. Ignorance, however, must be
      excused, and hers was worthy of excuse; for the most blinding passion is
      love, and the most blinded of persons is a woman, since she has not
      strength enough to conduct so weighty a matter wisely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Geburon,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;you are departing from your own excellent custom
      so as to make yourself of like mind with your fellows; but there are women
      who have endured love and jealousy in patience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;and pleasantly too; for the most sensible are those
      who take as much amusement in laughing at their husbands&rsquo; doings, as their
      husbands take in secretly deceiving them. If you will make it my turn, so
      that the Lady Oisille may close the day, I will tell you a story about a
      wife and her husband who are known to all of us here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Begin, then,&rdquo; said Nomerfide; and Hircan, laughing, began thus:&mdash;

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>On finding her husband bolting meal in the garb of her
     serving-woman, whom he was awaiting in the hope that he
     would obtain from her what he desired, a certain lady showed
     such good sense that she was content to laugh and make merry
     at his folly</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      At the castle of Odoz (1) in Bigorre, there dwelt one Charles, equerry to
      the King and an Italian by birth, who had married a very virtuous and
      honourable woman. After bearing him many children, she was now grown old,
      whilst he also was not young. And he lived with her in all peacefulness
      and affection, for although he would at times speak with his
      serving-women, his excellent wife took no notice of this, but quietly
      dismissed them whenever she found that they were becoming too familiar in
      her house.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  The scene of this tale is laid at the castle where
     Margaret died. Ste. Marthe in his <i>Oraison funèbre</i>,
     pronounced at Alençon fifteen days after the Queen&rsquo;s death,
     formally states that she expired at Odos near Tarbes. He is
     not likely to have been mistaken, so that Brantome&rsquo;s
     assertion that the Queen died at Audos in Beam may be
     accepted as incorrect (<i>ante</i>, vol. i. p. lxxxviii.). It is
     further probable that the above tale was actually written at
     Odos (<i>ante</i>, vol. i. p. lxxxvi.), but the authenticity of
     the incidents is very doubtful, as there is an extremely
     similar story in the <i>Cent Nouvelles Nouvelles</i> (No, xvii.
     <i>Le Conseiller au bluteau</i>), in which the hero of the
     adventure is a &ldquo;great clerk and knight who presided over the
     Court of Accounts in Paris.&rdquo; For subsequent imitations see
     Malespini&rsquo;s <i>Ducento Novelle</i> (No. xcvii.) and <i>Les Joyeuses
     Adventures et Nouvelles Recreations</i> (No. xix.)&mdash;L. and Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      One day she hired a discreet and worthy girl, telling her of her husband&rsquo;s
      temper and her own, and how she was wont to turn away such girls whom she
      found to be wantons. This maid, wishing to continue in her mistress&rsquo;s
      service and esteem, resolved to remain a virtuous woman; and although her
      master often spoke to her, she on her part gave no heed to his words save
      that she repeated them to her mistress, and they thus both derived much
      diversion from his folly.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day the maid was in a back room bolting meal, and wearing her &ldquo;sarot,&rdquo;
       a kind of hood which, after the fashion of that country, not only formed a
      coif but covered the whole of the back and shoulders. Her master, finding
      her in this trim, came and urged her very pressingly, and, although she
      would not have done such a thing even to save her life, she pretended to
      consent, and asked leave to go first and see whether her mistress was
      engaged in some such manner that they might not be surprised together. To
      this he agreed; whereupon she begged him to put her hood upon his head and
      to continue bolting whilst she was away, in order that her mistress might
      still hear the noise of the bolter. And this he gladly did, in the hope of
      obtaining what he sought.
    </p>
    <p>
      The maid, who was by no means inclined to melancholy, ran off to her
      mistress and said to her&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come and see your good husband, whom I have taught to bolt in order to be
      rid of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wife made all speed to behold this new serving-woman, and when she saw
      her husband with the hood upon his head and the bolter in his hands, she
      began to laugh so exceedingly, clapping her hands the while, that she was
      scarce able to say to him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much dost want a month, wench, for thy labour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The husband, on hearing this voice, realised that he had been deceived,
      and, throwing down both what he was holding and wearing, he ran at the
      girl, calling her a thousand bad names. Had his wife not set herself in
      front of the maid, he would have given her wage enough for her quarter;
      but at last all was settled to the content of the parties concerned, and
      thenceforward they lived together without quarrelling. (2)

     2  The Italian Charles, equerry to the King, to whom the
     leading part is assigned in Queen Margaret&rsquo;s tale, may have
     been Charles de San Severino, who figures among the
     equerries with a salary of 200 <i>livres</i>, in the roll of the
     royal household for 1522. The San Severino family, one of
     the most prominent of Naples, had attached itself to the
     French cause at the time of the expedition of Charles VIII.,
     whom several of its members followed to France. In 1522 we
     find a &ldquo;Monsieur de Saint-Severin&rdquo; holding the office of
     first <i>maître d&rsquo;hôtel</i> to Francis I., and over a course of
     several years his son figures among the <i>enfants

      &ldquo;What say you, ladies, of this wife? Was she not sensible to make sport of
      her husband&rsquo;s sport?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Twas no sport,&rdquo; said Saffredent, &ldquo;for the husband who failed in his
      purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; said Ennasuite, &ldquo;that he had more delight in laughing with
      his wife, than at killing himself at his age with his serving-woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still, I should be sorely vexed,&rdquo; said Simontault, &ldquo;to be discovered so
      bravely coifed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;that it was not your wife&rsquo;s fault that
      she did not once discover you in very much the same attire in spite of all
      your craft, and that since then she has known no repose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rest content with what befalls your own house,&rdquo; said Simontault, &ldquo;without
      inquiring into what befalls mine. Nevertheless, my wife has no reason to
      complain of me, and even did I act as you say, she would never have
      occasion to notice it through any lack of what she might need.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Virtuous women,&rdquo; said Longarine, &ldquo;require nothing but the love of their
      husbands, which alone can satisfy them. Those who seek a brutish
      satisfaction will never find it where honour enjoins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you call it brutish,&rdquo; asked Geburon, &ldquo;if a wife desires that her
      husband should give her her due?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say,&rdquo; said Longarine, &ldquo;that a chaste woman, whose heart is filled with
      true love, is more content to be perfectly loved than to have all the
      delights that the body can desire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am of your opinion,&rdquo; said Dagoucin, &ldquo;but my lords here will neither
      hear it nor confess it. I think if mutual love cannot satisfy a woman, her
      husband alone will not do so; for unless she live in the love that is
      honourable for a woman, she must be tempted by the infernal lustfulness of
      brutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In truth,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;you remind me of a lady who was both handsome
      and well wedded, but who, through not living in that honourable love,
      became more carnal than swine and more cruel than lions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ask you, madam,&rdquo; said Simontault, &ldquo;to end the day by telling us her
      story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I cannot do,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;and for two reasons. The first is that
      it is exceedingly long; and the second, that it does not belong to our own
      day. It is written indeed by an author worthy of belief; but we are sworn
      to relate nothing that has been written.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said Parlamente; &ldquo;but I believe I know the story you mean,
      and it is written in such old language that methinks no one present except
      ourselves has ever heard of it. It will therefore be looked upon as new.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upon this the whole company begged her to tell it without fear for its
      length, seeing that a full hour was yet left before vespers. So, at their
      request, the Lady Oisille thus began:&mdash;

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>The Duchess of Burgundy, not content with the love that her
     husband bore her, conceived so great an affection for a
     young gentleman that, when looks and glances were not
     sufficient to inform him of her passion, she declared it to
     him in words which led to an evil ending</i>. (1)

     1  This story is borrowed from an old <i>fabliau</i>, known under
     the title of the <i>Châtelaine de Vergy</i>, which will be found
     in the <i>Recueil de Barbazan</i> (vol iv.) and in Legrand
     d&rsquo;Aussy&rsquo;s <i>Fabliaux</i> (vol iii.). Margaret calls the lady
     Madame du Vergier (literally the lady of the orchard) in her
     tale. Bandello imitated the same <i>fabliau</i> in his <i>Novelle</i>
     (1554; part iv. nov. v.), but gave it a different ending.
     Belleforest subsequently adapted it for his <i>Histoires
     Tragiques</i>. Margaret&rsquo;s tale may also be compared with No.
     lxii. of the <i>Cento Novelle antiche</i>, p. 84 of the edition
     of Florence, 1825.&mdash;L. and M.
</pre>
    <p>
      In the Duchy of Burgundy there was a Duke who was a very honourable and
      handsome Prince. He had married a wife whose beauty pleased him so greatly
      that it kept him from knowledge of her character, and he took thought only
      how he might please her, whilst she made excellent show of returning his
      affection. Now the Duke had in his household a gentleman filled with all
      the perfection that could be sought for in a man. He was loved by all,
      more especially by the Duke, who had reared him from childhood near his
      own person; and, finding him possessed of such excellent qualities, the
      Duke loved him exceedingly and trusted him with all such matters as one of
      his years could understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duchess, who had not the heart of a virtuous woman and Princess, and
      was not content with the love that her husband bore her and the good
      treatment that she had at his hands, often observed this gentleman, and so
      much to her liking did she find him, that she loved him beyond measure.
      This she strove unceasingly to make known to him, as well by soft and
      piteous glances as by sighs and passionate looks.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the gentleman, whose inclinations had ever been to virtue alone, could
      not perceive wickedness in a lady who had so little excuse for it, and so
      the glances and looks of the poor wanton bore no fruit save her own
      frenzied despair. This at last drove her to extremes, and forgetting that
      she was a woman fit to be entreated and yet to refuse, and a Princess made
      to be worshipped by such lovers and yet to hold them in scorn, she acted
      with the spirit of a man transported by passion, with a view to rid
      herself of the fire which she could no longer endure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, one day when her husband was gone to the council, at which
      the gentleman by reason of his youth was not present, she beckoned him to
      come to her, which he did, thinking that she had some command to give him.
      But leaning on his arm, like a woman wearied with repose, she brought him
      to walk in a gallery, where she said to him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I marvel that you who are so handsome and young, and full of excellent
      grace, have lived in this company, where are so many beautiful ladies, and
      yet have been lover or true knight to none.&rdquo; Then, looking at him as
      graciously as she was able, she waited for his reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if I were worthy that your Highness should stoop to
      think of me, you would have still greater reason to marvel at seeing a man
      so little worthy of love as I am, offer his service where it would be
      rejected or scorned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On hearing this discreet reply, the Duchess felt she loved him more than
      before. She vowed to him that there was not a lady at her Court who would
      not be only too happy to have such a knight, and that he might well make
      an adventure of the sort, since there was no danger but he would come out
      of it with honour. The gentleman kept his eyes downcast, not daring to
      meet her looks, which were hot enough to melt ice; but, just as he was
      trying to excuse himself, the Duke sent for the Duchess to come to the
      council on some matter that concerned her, and thither with much regret
      she went. The gentleman never afterwards made the slightest sign of having
      understood a word of what she had said to him, at which she was
      exceedingly distressed and vexed; and she knew not to what cause to impute
      her failure, unless it were to the foolish fear of which she deemed the
      gentleman to be possessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days afterwards, finding that he gave no sign of understanding what
      she had said, she resolved on her part to set aside all fear or shame, and
      to tell him of her love. She felt sure that beauty such as hers could not
      be otherwise than well received, although she would fain have had the
      honour of being wooed. However, she set her honour on one side for her
      pleasure&rsquo;s sake, and after she had several times attempted the same
      fashion of discourse as at first, but without receiving any reply to her
      liking, she one day plucked the gentleman by the sleeve, and told him that
      she must speak to him on certain matters of weight. The gentleman went
      with the humility and reverence that were her due to a deep window into
      which she had withdrawn; and, on perceiving that no one in the room could
      see her, she began in a trembling voice, that halted between desire and
      fear, to continue her former discourse, rebuking him for not yet having
      chosen some lady in the company, and promising him that, no matter who it
      might be, she would help him to win kindly treatment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman, who was no less vexed than astonished by her words, replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam, my heart is so tender, that, were I once refused, I should never
      again have joy in this world; and I know myself to be of such little worth
      that no lady at this Court would deign to accept my suit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Duchess blushed, and, imagining that at last he was indeed won, vowed
      to him that she knew the most beautiful lady in the company would, if he
      were willing, joyfully receive him, and afford him perfect happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! madam,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I do not think that there is any woman in this
      company so unfortunate and so blind as to find me worthy of her love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Duchess, finding that he would not understand her, drew the veil of
      her passion somewhat aside, and, by reason of the fears which the
      gentleman&rsquo;s virtue caused her, spoke to him in the form of a question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If fortune,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;had so far favoured you that it was myself who
      bore you this goodwill, what would you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman, who thought that he was dreaming when he heard her speak in
      this wise, dropped on his knee, and replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam, when God by His favour enables me to have both the favour of the
      Duke, my master, and your own, I shall deem myself the happiest man alive;
      for &lsquo;tis the reward I crave for the loyal service of one who, more than
      any other, is bound to give his life in the service of you both. And I am
      sure, madam, that the love you bear my Lord aforesaid is attended with
      such chastity and nobleness that, apart from myself, who am but a worm of
      the earth, not even the greatest Prince and most perfect man to be found
      could break the union that exists between you. For my own part, my Lord
      has brought me up from childhood, and made me what I am, and to save my
      life I could not entertain towards any wife, daughter, sister or mother of
      his any thought contrary to what is due from a loyal and faithful
      servant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Duchess would not allow him to continue, but finding that she was in
      danger of obtaining a dishonourable refusal, she suddenly interrupted him,
      and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wicked and boastful fool, who seeks any such thing from you? Do you think
      that your good looks win you the love of the very flies in the air? Nay,
      if you were presumptuous enough to address yourself to me, I would show
      you that I love, and seek to love, none but my husband. What I have said
      to you was spoken only for my amusement, to try you and laugh at you, as I
      do at all foolish lovers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said the gentleman, &ldquo;I believed, and do still believe, that it is
      as you say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, without listening further, she withdrew in haste to her own
      apartment, and, finding that she was followed by her ladies, went into her
      closet, where she sorrowed after a fashion that cannot be described. On
      the one part, the love wherein she had failed caused her mortal sadness;
      on the other, her anger, both against herself for having entered upon such
      foolish talk and against the gentleman for his discreet reply, drove her
      into such fury that at one moment she wished to make away with herself,
      and at another, to live that she might avenge herself on one whom she now
      regarded as her deadly enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had wept for a long while, she made pretence of being ill, in
      order that she might not be present at the Duke&rsquo;s supper, at which the
      gentleman was commonly in waiting. The Duke, who loved his wife better
      than he did himself, came to see her; but the more effectually to work her
      end, she told him that she believed herself to be with child, and that her
      pregnancy had caused a rheum to come upon her eyes, which gave her much
      pain. So passed two or three days, during which the Duchess kept her bed
      in sadness and melancholy, until at last the Duke thought that something
      further must be the matter. He therefore came at night to sleep with her;
      but, finding that for all he could do he could in no sort check her sighs,
      he said to her&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, sweetheart, that I love you as dearly as my life, and that if
      yours were lacking I could not endure my own. If therefore you would
      preserve my health, I pray you tell me what causes you to sigh after this
      manner; for I cannot believe that such unhappiness can come only because
      you are with child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Duchess, finding that her husband was disposed to her just as she
      could have wished him to be, thought that the time was come to seek
      vengeance for her affliction; and embracing the Duke, she began to weep,
      and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, my lord, my greatest unhappiness is to see you deceived by those on
      whom is so deep an obligation to guard your substance and your honour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Duke, on hearing this, was very desirous of knowing why she spoke in
      that manner, and earnestly begged her to make the truth known to him
      without fear. After refusing several times, she said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall never wonder, my lord, that foreigners make war on Princes, when
      those who are in duty most bound to them, wage upon them a war so cruel
      that loss of territory were nothing in comparison. I say this, my lord, in
      reference to a certain gentleman&rdquo; (naming her enemy) &ldquo;who, though reared
      by your own hand and treated more like a son than a servant, has made a
      cruel and base attempt to ruin the honour of your wife, in which is also
      bound up the honour of your house and your children. Although for a long
      time he showed me such looks as pointed to his wicked purpose, yet my
      heart, which only cares for you, understood nothing of them; and so at
      last he declared himself in words to which I returned a reply such as
      beseemed my condition and my chastity. Nevertheless, I now so hate him
      that I cannot endure to look at him, and for this cause I have continued
      in my own apartment and lost the happiness of fellowship with you. I
      entreat you, my lord, keep not this pestilence near your person; for,
      after such a crime, he might fear lest I should tell you of it, and so
      attempt worse. This, my lord, is the cause of my sorrow, and methinks it
      were right and fitting that you should deal with it forthwith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Duke, who on the one hand loved his wife and felt himself grievously
      affronted, and on the other loved his servant, whose faithfulness he had
      so fully tried that he could scarce believe this falsehood against him,
      was in great distress and filled with anger. Repairing to his own room, he
      sent word to the gentleman to come no more into his presence, but to
      withdraw to his lodging for a time. The gentleman, being ignorant of the
      cause of this, was grieved exceedingly, for he knew that he had deserved
      the opposite of such unworthy treatment. Aware, then, of his own innocence
      in heart and deed, he sent a comrade to speak to the Duke and take him a
      letter, humbly entreating that if any evil report had caused his
      banishment, his master would be pleased to suspend judgment until he had
      heard from himself the truth of the matter, when it would be found that he
      had been guilty of no offence.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Duke saw this letter, his anger was somewhat abated. He secretly
      sent for the gentleman to his own room, and with wrathful countenance said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could never have thought that the care I took to rear you as my own
      child would be changed into regret at having so highly advanced you; but
      you have attempted what was more hurtful to me than loss of life or
      substance, and have sought to assail the honour of one who is half myself,
      and so bring infamy on my house and name. You may be assured that this
      outrage is so wounding to my heart that, were it not for my doubt whether
      it be true or not, you would have already been at the bottom of the water,
      and so have received in secret due punishment for the wrong that in secret
      you intended against me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman was in no wise dismayed by this discourse, but, ignorant as
      he was of the truth, spoke forth with confidence and entreated the Duke to
      name his accuser, since such a charge should be justified rather with the
      lance than with the tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your accuser,&rdquo; said the Duke, &ldquo;carries no weapon but chastity. Know,
      then, that none other but my wife has told me this, and she begged me to
      take vengeance upon you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The poor gentleman, though he then perceived the lady&rsquo;s great wickedness,
      would not accuse her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;my lady may say what she will. You know her better
      than I do, and you are aware if ever I saw her when out of your sight,
      save only on one occasion, when she spoke but little with me. You have,
      moreover, as sound a judgment as any Prince alive; wherefore I pray you,
      my lord, judge whether you have ever seen aught in me to cause any
      suspicion; and remember love is a fire that cannot be hidden so as never
      to be known of by those who have had a like distemper. So I pray you, my
      lord, to believe two things of me: first, that my loyalty to you is such
      that were my lady, your wife, the fairest being in the world, love would
      never avail to make me stain my honour and fidelity; and secondly, that
      even were she not your wife, I should be least in love with her of all the
      women I have ever known, since there are many others to whom I would
      sooner plight my troth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On hearing these words of truth, the Duke began to be softened, and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you, on my part, that I did not believe it. Do, therefore,
      according to your wont, in the assurance that, if I find the truth to be
      on your side, I will love you yet better than before. But if it be not so,
      your life is in my hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman thanked him and offered to submit to any pain or penalty if
      he were found guilty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duchess, on seeing the gentleman again in waiting as had formerly been
      his wont, could not endure it in patience, but said to her husband&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Twould be no more than you deserve, my lord, if you were poisoned, since
      you put more trust in your deadly enemies than in your friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pray you, sweetheart, do not torment yourself in this matter,&rdquo; said the
      Duke. &ldquo;If I find that you have told me true, I promise you he shall not
      live four and twenty hours. But he has sworn to the contrary, and I have
      myself never perceived any such fault, and so I cannot believe it without
      complete proof.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In good sooth, my lord,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;your goodness renders his
      wickedness the greater. What more complete proof would you have than this,
      that no love affair has ever been imputed to him? Believe me, my lord,
      were it not for the lofty purpose that he took into his head of being my
      lover, he would not have continued so long without a mistress; for never
      did a young man live solitary as he does in such good company, unless he
      had fixed his heart so high as to be content merely with his own vain
      hope. Since, then, you think that he is not hiding the truth from you, put
      him, I beg you, on oath as regards his love. If he loves another, I am
      content that you should believe him, and if not, you will know that what I
      say is true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Duke thought his wife&rsquo;s reasonings very good, and, taking the
      gentleman into the country with him, said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My wife continues still of the same mind, and has set before me an
      argument that causes me grave suspicion against you. It is deemed strange
      that you who are so gallant and young have never been known to love, and
      this makes me think that you have such affection for her as she says, and
      that the hope it gives you renders you content to think of no other woman.
      As a friend, therefore, I pray you, and as a master I command you to tell
      me whether you are in love with any lady on earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Although the gentleman would have fain concealed his passion yet as he
      loved his life, he was obliged, on seeing his master&rsquo;s jealousy, to swear
      to him that he did indeed love one whose beauty was so great, that the
      beauty of the Duchess or of any lady of the Court would be simply ugliness
      beside it. But he entreated that he might never be compelled to name her,
      since the agreement between himself and his sweetheart was of such a
      nature that it could not be broken excepting by whichever of them should
      be the first to make it known.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke promised not to urge him, and being quite satisfied with him,
      treated him with more kindness than ever before. The Duchess perceived
      this, and set herself with her wonted craft to find out the reason. The
      Duke did not hide it from her; whereupon strong jealousy sprang up beside
      her desire for vengeance, and she begged her husband to command the
      gentleman to name his sweetheart. She assured him that the story was a
      lie, and that the course she urged was the best means of testing it. If
      the gentleman, said she, did not name her whom he deemed so beautiful, and
      his master believed him on his mere word, he would indeed be the most
      foolish Prince alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor Duke, whose wife directed his thoughts at her pleasure, went to
      walk alone with the gentleman, and told him that he was in even greater
      trouble than before; for he was greatly minded to believe that he had been
      given an excuse to keep him from suspecting the truth. This was a greater
      torment to him than ever; and he therefore begged the gentleman, as
      earnestly as he was able, to name her whom he loved so dearly. The poor
      gentleman entreated that he might not be made to commit so great an
      offence against his mistress as to break the promise he had given her and
      had kept so long, and thus lose in a day all that he had preserved for
      seven years. And he added that he would rather suffer death than in this
      wise wrong one who had been true to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke, finding that he would not tell him, became deeply jealous, and
      with a wrathful countenance exclaimed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, choose one of two things: either tell me whom you love more than
      any other, or else go into banishment from the territories over which I
      rule, under pain of a cruel death if you be found within them after a week
      is over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If ever heart of loyal servant was torn with anguish, it was so with that
      of this poor gentleman, who might well have said, <i>Angustiæ sunt mihi
      undique</i>, for on the one part he saw that by telling the truth he would
      lose his mistress, if she learned that he had failed in his promise to
      her; while, if he did not confess it, he would be banished from the land
      in which she dwelt, and be no more able to see her. Hard pressed in this
      manner on all sides, there came upon him a cold sweat, as on one whose
      sorrow was bringing him near to death. The Duke, observing his looks,
      concluded that he loved no other lady than the Duchess, and was enduring
      this suffering because he was able to name none other. He therefore said
      to him with considerable harshness&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If what you say were true, you would not have so much trouble in telling
      me; but methinks &lsquo;tis your crime that is tormenting you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman, piqued by these words, and impelled by the love that he
      bore his master, resolved to tell him the truth, believing that he was too
      honourable a man ever, on any account, to reveal it. Accordingly, throwing
      himself upon his knees, and clasping his hands, he said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord, the duty that I owe to you and the love that I bear you
      constrain me more than the fear of any death. I can see that you imagine
      and judge falsely concerning me, and, to take this trouble from you, I am
      resolved to do that to which no torment had compelled me. But I pray you,
      my lord, swear to me by the honour of God, and promise me by your own
      faith as a Prince and a Christian, that you will never reveal the secret
      which, since it so pleases you, I am obliged to tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upon this the Duke swore to him with all the oaths he could think of that
      he would never reveal aught of it to any living being, whether by speech,
      or writing, or feature. Then the young man, feeling confidence in so
      virtuous a Prince as he knew his master to be, began the building up of
      his misfortune, and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is now seven years, my lord, since knowing your niece, the Lady du
      Vergier, to be a widow and without kindred, I set myself to win her
      favour. But, since I was of too lowly a birth to wed her, I contented
      myself with being received by her as her true knight, as indeed I have
      been. And it has pleased God that the affair has hitherto been contrived
      with much discretion, so that neither man nor woman knows of it save
      ourselves alone, and now, my lord, you also. I place my life and honour in
      your hands, entreating you to keep the matter secret and to esteem your
      niece none the less; for I think that under heaven there is no more
      perfect being.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If ever man was rejoiced it was the Duke, for, knowing as he did the
      exceeding beauty of his niece, he now had no doubt that she was more
      pleasing than his wife. However, being unable to understand how so great a
      mystery could have been contrived, he begged the gentleman to tell him how
      it was that he was able to see her. The gentleman related to him then that
      his lady&rsquo;s chamber looked upon a garden, and that, on the days when he was
      to visit her, a little gate was left open through which he went in on foot
      until he heard the barking of a little dog which the lady used to loose in
      the garden when all her women were withdrawn. Then he went and conversed
      with her all night long, and, in parting from her, would appoint a day on
      which he would return; and this appointment, unless for some weighty
      reason, he never failed to keep. The Duke, who was the most inquisitive
      man alive, and who had made love in no small degree in his day, wished
      both to satisfy his suspicions and to fully understand so strange a
      business; and he therefore begged the gentleman to take him, not as a
      master but as a companion, the next time he went thither. To this the
      gentleman, having gone so far already, consented, saying that he had an
      appointment for that very day; at which the Duke was as glad as if he had
      gained a kingdom. Making pretence of retiring to rest in his closet, he
      caused two horses to be brought for himself and the gentleman, and they
      travelled all night long from Argilly, where the Duke lived, to Le
      Vergier. (2)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     2  At Argilly the Dukes of Burgundy had a castle, which was
     destroyed during the religious wars at the close of the
     sixteenth century. The place is now a small village in the
     arrondissement of Nuits, Côte d&rsquo;Or. As the crow flies, it is
     some ten miles distant from the ruins of the castle of
     Vergy, which stands on a steep height, at an altitude of
     over 1600 ft., within five miles from Nuits. The castle,
     which can only be reached on one side of the hill, by a
     narrow, winding and precipitous pathway, is known to have
     been in existence already in the tenth century, when the
     Lords of Vergy were Counts of Chalons, Beaune, and Nuits.
     They appear to have engaged in a struggle for supremacy with
     the princes of the first Ducal house of Burgundy, but in
     1193 Alix de Vergy espoused Duke Eudes III., to whom she
     brought, as dower, the greater part of the paternal
     inheritance. The castle of Vergy was dismantled by Henry
     IV., and the existing ruins are of small extent. Some
     antiquaries believe the fortress to have been originally
     built by the Romans.&mdash;B.J. and L.
</pre>
    <p>
      Then they left their horses without the wall, and the gentleman brought
      the Duke into the garden through the little gate, begging him to remain
      behind a walnut-tree, whence he might see whether he had been told the
      truth or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had been but a short time in the garden when the little dog began to
      bark, and the gentleman walked towards the tower, where his lady failed
      not to come and meet him. She kissed him, saying that it seemed a thousand
      years since she had seen him, and then they went into the chamber and shut
      the door behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having seen the whole of the mystery, the Duke felt more than satisfied.
      Nor had he a great while to wait, for the gentleman told his mistress that
      he must needs return sooner than was his wont, since the Duke was to go
      hunting at four o&rsquo;clock, and he durst not fail to attend him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady, who set honour before delight, would not keep him from
      fulfilling his duty; for what she prized most in their honourable
      affection was that it was kept secret from all.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the gentleman departed an hour after midnight, and his lady in cloak
      and kerchief went with him, yet not so far as she wished, for, fearing
      lest she should meet the Duke, he obliged her to return. Then he mounted
      with the Duke and returned to the castle of Argilly, his master
      unceasingly swearing to him on the way that he would die rather than ever
      reveal his secret. Moreover, he then put so much trust in the gentleman,
      and had so much love for him, that no one in his Court stood higher in his
      favour. The Duchess grew furious at this, but the Duke forbade her ever to
      speak to him about the gentleman again, saying that he now knew the truth
      about him and was well pleased, since the lady in question was more worthy
      of love than herself. These words deeply pierced the heart of the Duchess,
      and she fell into a sickness that was worse than fever.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke went to see her in order to comfort her, but there was no means
      of doing this except by telling her the name of this beautiful and dearly
      loved lady. She pressed him urgently to do this, until at last the Duke
      went out of the room, saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you speak to me again after this fashion, we shall part one from the
      other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words increased the sickness of the Duchess, and she pretended that
      she felt her infant stirring, at which the Duke was so rejoiced that he
      came and lay beside her. But, just when she saw him most loving towards
      her, she turned away, and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pray you, my lord, since you have no love for either wife or child,
      leave us to die together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words she gave vent to many tears and lamentations, and the
      Duke was in great fear lest she should lose her child. He therefore took
      her in his arms and begged her to tell him what she would have, since he
      possessed nothing that was not also hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my lord,&rdquo; she replied, weeping, &ldquo;what hope can I have that you would
      do a hard thing for me, when you will not do the easiest and most
      reasonable in the world, which is to name to me the mistress of the
      wickedest servant you ever had? I thought that you and I had but one
      heart, one soul, and one flesh. But now I see that you look upon me as a
      stranger, seeing that your secrets, which should be known to me, are
      hidden from me as though I were a stranger. Alas! my lord, you have told
      me many weighty and secret matters, of which you have never known me to
      speak, you have proved my will to be like to your own, and you cannot
      doubt but that I am less myself than you. And if you have sworn never to
      tell the gentleman&rsquo;s secret to another, you will not break your oath in
      telling it to me, for I am not and cannot be other than yourself. I have
      you in my heart, I hold you in my arms, I have in my womb a child in whom
      you live, and yet I may not have your heart as you have mine. The more
      faithful and true I am to you, the more cruel and stern are you to me, so
      that a thousand times a day do I long by a sudden death to rid my child of
      such a father and myself of such a husband. And I hope that this will be
      ere long, since you set a faithless servant before a wife such as 1 am to
      you, and before the life of the mother of your child, which will perish
      because I cannot have of you that which I most desire to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, she embraced and kissed her husband, and watered his face with
      her tears, uttering the while such lamentations and sighs that the good
      Prince feared to lose wife and child together, and resolved to tell her
      all the truth of the matter. Nevertheless, he first swore to her that if
      ever she revealed it to a living being she should die by his own hand; and
      she agreed to and accepted this punishment. Then the poor, deceived
      husband told her all that he had seen from beginning to end, and she made
      show of being well pleased. In her heart she was minded very differently,
      but through fear of the Duke she concealed her passion as well as she was
      able.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now on a certain great feast-day the Duke held his Court, to which he had
      bidden all the ladies of that country, and among the rest his niece. When
      the dances began, all did their duty save the Duchess, who, tormented by
      the sight of her niece&rsquo;s beauty and grace, could neither make merry nor
      prevent her spleen from being perceived. At last she called all the
      ladies, and making them scat themselves around her, began to talk of love;
      and seeing that the Lady du Vergier said nothing, she asked her, with a
      heart which jealousy was rending&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, fair niece, is it possible that your beauty has found no lover
      or true knight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; replied the Lady du Vergier, &ldquo;my beauty has not yet made such a
      conquest. Since my husband&rsquo;s death I have sought to love none but his
      children, with whom I deem myself happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fair niece, fair niece,&rdquo; replied the Duchess, with hateful spleen, &ldquo;there
      is no love so secret that it is not known, and no little dog so well
      broken in and trained that it cannot be heard to bark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I leave you to imagine, ladies, what sorrow the poor Lady du Vergier felt
      in her heart on finding a matter, so long concealed, thus made known to
      her great dishonour. Her honour, which had been so carefully guarded and
      was now wofully lost, tortured her, but still more so her suspicion that
      her lover had failed in his promise to her. This she did not think he
      could have done, unless it were that he loved some lady fairer than
      herself, to whom his love had constrained him to make the whole matter
      known. Yet so great was her discretion that she gave no sign, but replied
      laughing to the Duchess that she did not understand the language of
      animals. However, beneath this prudent concealment her heart was filled
      with sadness, so that she rose up, and, passing out of the chamber,
      entered a closet in sight of the Duke, who was walking up and down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having thus reached a place where she believed herself to be alone, the
      poor lady let herself fall helplessly upon a bed, whereat a damsel, who
      had sat down beside it to sleep, rose up and drew back the curtains to see
      who this might be. Finding that it was the Lady du Vergier, who believed
      herself to be alone, she durst say nothing to her, but listened, making as
      little noise as she was able. And in a stifled voice the poor Lady du
      Vergier began to lament, saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O unhappy one, what words have I heard? to what decree of death have I
      hearkened? what final sentence have I received? O best beloved of men, is
      this the reward of my chaste, honourable and virtuous love? O my heart,
      hast thou made so parlous an election, and chosen for the most loyal the
      most faithless, for the truest the most false, for the discreetest the
      most slanderous? Alas! can it be that a thing hidden from every human eye
      has been revealed to the Duchess? Alas, my little dog, so well taught and
      the sole instrument of my love and virtuous affection, it was not you who
      betrayed me, it was he whose voice is louder than a dog&rsquo;s bark, and whose
      heart is more thankless than any brute&rsquo;s. Tis he who, contrary to his oath
      and promise, has made known the happy life which, wronging none, we so
      long have led together. O my beloved, the love of whom alone has entered
      into my heart, and preserved my life, must you now be declared my deadly
      foe, while mine honour is given to the winds, my body to the dust, and my
      soul to its everlasting abode? Is the beauty of the Duchess so exceeding
      great that, like the beauty of Circe, it has bewitched and transformed
      you? Has she turned you from virtue to vice, from goodness to wickedness,
      from being a man to be a beast of prey? O my beloved, though you have
      failed in your promise to me, yet will I keep mine to you, and, now that
      our love has been revealed, will never see you more. Nevertheless, I
      cannot live without your presence, and so I gladly yield to my exceeding
      sorrow, and will seek for it no cure either in reason or in medicine.
      Death alone shall end it, and death will be sweeter to me than life on
      earth without lover, honour or happiness. Neither war nor death has robbed
      me of my lover; no sin or fault of mine has robbed me of my honour;
      neither error nor demerit of mine has made me lose my joy. &lsquo;Tis cruel fate
      that has rendered the most favoured of men thankless, and has caused me to
      receive the contrary of that which I deserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my Lady Duchess, what delight it was to you to taunt me with my
      little dog! Rejoice, then, in the happiness you owe to me alone; taunt her
      who thought by careful concealment and virtuous love to be free from any
      taunt. Ah! how those words have bruised my heart! how they have made me
      blush for shame and pale for jealousy! Alas, my heart, I feel that thou
      art indeed undone! The wicked love that has discovered me burns thee;
      jealousy of thee and evil intent towards thee are to thee as ice and
      death; while wrath and sorrow do not suffer me to comfort thee. Alas, poor
      soul, that in adoring the creature didst forget the Creator, thou must
      return into the hands of Him from whom vain love tore thee away. Have
      trust, my soul, that thou wilt find in Him a Father kinder than was the
      lover for whose sake thou hast so often forgotten Him. O my God, my
      Creator, Thou who art the true and perfect love, by whose grace the love I
      bore to my beloved has been stained by no blemish save that of too great
      an affection, I implore Thee in mercy to receive the soul-and spirit of
      one who repents that she has broken thy first and most just commandment.
      And, through the merits of Him whose love passeth all understanding,
      forgive the error into which excess of love has led me, for in Thee alone
      do I put my perfect trust. And farewell, O my beloved, whose empty name
      doth break my very heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words she fell backward, and her face grew pallid, her lips
      blue, and her extremities cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just at this moment the gentleman she loved came into the hall, and,
      seeing the Duchess dancing with the ladies, looked everywhere for his
      sweetheart. Not finding her, he went into the chamber of the Duchess, and
      there found the Duke, who was walking up and down, and who, guessing his
      purpose, whispered in his ear&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She went into that closet, and methought she was ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman asked whether he would be pleased to let him go in, and the
      Duke begged him to do so. When he entered the closet he found the Lady du
      Vergier, come to the last stage of her mortal life; whereat, throwing his
      arms about her, he said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is this, sweetheart? Would you leave me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The poor lady, hearing the voice that she knew so well, recovered a little
      strength and opened her eyes to look upon him who was the cause of her
      death; but at this look her love and anguish waxed so great that, with a
      piteous sigh, she yielded up her soul to God.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman, more dead than the dead woman herself, asked the damsel who
      was there how this sickness had come upon his sweetheart, and she told him
      all the words that she had heard. Then the gentleman knew that the Duke
      had revealed the secret to his wife, and felt such frenzy that, whilst
      embracing his sweetheart&rsquo;s body, he for a long time watered it with his
      tears, saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O traitorous, wicked and unhappy lover that I am! why has not the
      punishment of my treachery fallen upon me, and not upon her who is
      innocent? Why was I not struck by a bolt from heaven on the day when my
      tongue revealed the secret and virtuous love between us? Why did not the
      earth open to swallow up this traitor to his troth? O tongue, mayest thou
      be punished as was the tongue of the wicked rich man in hell!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O heart, too fearful of death and banishment, mayest thou be torn
      continually by eagles as was the heart of Ixion! (3)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     3  Queen Margaret&rsquo;s memory plainly failed her here.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, sweetheart, the greatest of all the greatest woes has fallen upon
      me! I thought to keep you, but I have lost you; I thought to see you for a
      long time and to abide with you in sweet and honourable content, yet now I
      embrace your dead body, and you passed away in sore displeasure with me,
      with my heart and with my tongue. O most loyal and faithful of women, I do
      confess myself the most disloyal, fickle and faithless of all men. Gladly
      would I complain of the Duke in whose promise I trusted, hoping thus to
      continue our happy life; but alas! I should have known that none could
      keep our secret better than I kept it myself. The Duke had more reason in
      telling his secret to his wife than I in telling mine to him. I accuse
      none but myself of the greatest wickedness that was ever done between
      lovers. I ought to have submitted to be cast into the moat as he
      threatened to do with me; at least, sweetheart, you would then have lived
      in widowhood and I have died a glorious death in observing the law that
      true love enjoins. But through breaking it I am now in life, and you,
      through perfectness of love, are dead; for your pure, clear heart could
      not bear to know the wickedness of your lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O my God! why didst Thou endow me with so light a love and so ignorant a
      heart? Why didst thou not create me as the little dog that faithfully
      served his mistress? Alas, my little friend, the joy your bark was wont to
      give me is turned to deadly sorrow, now that another than we twain has
      heard your voice. Yet, sweetheart, neither the love of the Duchess nor of
      any living woman turned me aside, though indeed that wicked one did often
      ask and entreat me. &lsquo;Twas by my ignorance, which thought to secure our
      love for ever, that I was overcome. Yet for that ignorance am I none the
      less guilty; for I revealed my sweetheart&rsquo;s secret and broke my promise to
      her, and for this cause alone do I see her lying dead before my eyes.
      Alas, sweetheart, death will to me be less cruel than to you, whose love
      has ended your innocent life. Methinks it would not deign to touch my
      faithless and miserable heart; for life with dishonour and the memory of
      that which I have lost through guilt would be harder to bear than ten
      thousand deaths. Alas, sweetheart, had any dared to slay you through
      mischance or malice, I should quickly have clapped hand to sword to avenge
      you; &lsquo;tis therefore right that I should not pardon the murderer who has
      caused your death by a more wicked act than any sword-thrust. Did I know a
      viler executioner than myself, I would entreat him to put your traitorous
      lover to death. O Love! I have offended thee from not having known how to
      love, and therefore thou wilt not succour me as thou didst succour her who
      kept all thy laws. &lsquo;Tis not right that I should die after so honourable a
      manner; but &lsquo;tis well that I should die by mine own hand. I have washed
      your face, sweet, with my tears, and with my tongue have craved your
      forgiveness; and now it only remains for my hand to make my body like unto
      yours, and send my soul whither yours will go, in the knowledge that a
      virtuous and honourable love can never end, whether in this world or in
      the next.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rising up from the body he then, like a frenzied man beside himself, drew
      his dagger and with great violence stabbed himself to the heart. Then he
      again took his sweetheart in his arms, kissing her with such passion that
      it seemed as though he were seized rather with love than with death.
    </p>
    <p>
      The damsel, seeing him deal himself the blow, ran to the door and called
      for help. The Duke, on hearing the outcry, suspected misfortune to those
      he loved, and was the first to enter the closet, where he beheld the
      piteous pair. He sought to separate them, and, if it were possible, to
      save the gentleman; but the latter clasped his sweetheart so fast that he
      could not be taken from her until he was dead. Nevertheless he heard the
      Duke speaking to him and saying&mdash;&ldquo;Alas! what is the cause of this?&rdquo;
       To which, with a glance of fury, he replied&mdash;&ldquo;My tongue, my lord, and
      yours.&rdquo; So saying, he died, with his face close pressed to that of his
      mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke, wishing to know more of the matter, made the damsel tell him
      what she had seen and heard; and this she did at full length, sparing
      nothing. Then the Duke, finding that he was himself the cause of all this
      woe, threw himself upon the two dead lovers, and, with great lamentation
      and weeping, kissed both of them several times and asked their
      forgiveness. And after that he rose up in fury, and drew the dagger from
      the gentleman&rsquo;s body; and, just as a wild boar, wounded with a spear,
      rushes headlong against him that has dealt the blow, so did the Duke now
      seek out her who had wounded him to the bottom of his soul. He found her
      dancing in the hall, and more merry than was her wont at the thought of
      the excellent vengeance she had wreaked on the Lady du Vergier.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke came upon her in the midst of the dance, and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You took the secret upon your life, and upon your life shall fall the
      punishment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he seized her by the head-dress and stabbed her with the dagger
      in the breast. All the company were astonished, and it was thought that
      the Duke was out of his mind; but, having thus worked his will, he brought
      all his retainers together in the hall and told them the virtuous and
      pitiful story of his niece, and the evil that his wife had wrought her.
      And those who were present wept whilst they listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the Duke ordered that his wife should be buried in an abbey which he
      founded partly to atone for the sin that he had committed in killing her;
      and he caused a beautiful tomb to be built, in which the bodies of his
      niece and the gentleman were laid together, with an epitaph setting forth
      their tragic story. And the Duke undertook an expedition against the
      Turks, in which God so favoured him, that he brought back both honour and
      profit. On his return, he found his eldest son now able to govern his
      possessions, and so left all to him, and went and became a monk in the
      abbey where his wife and the two lovers were buried. And there did he
      spend his old age happily with God.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such, ladies, is the story which you begged me to relate, and which, as I
      can see from your eyes, you have not heard without compassion. It seems to
      me that you should take example by it, and beware of placing your
      affections upon men; for, however honourable or virtuous these affections
      may be, in the end they have always an aftertaste of evil. You see how St.
      Paul would not that even married people should so deeply love each other;
      (4) for the more our hearts are set upon earthly things, the more remote
      are they from heavenly affection, and the harder is the tie to be broken.
      I therefore pray you, ladies, ask God for His Holy Spirit, who will so
      fire your hearts with the love of God, that when death comes, you will not
      be pained at leaving that which you love too well in this world.&rdquo;

    <p>
      &ldquo;If their love,&rdquo; said Geburon, &ldquo;was as honourable as you describe, why was
      it needful to keep it so secret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;the wickedness of men is so great, that they
      can never believe deep love to be allied with honour, but judge men and
      women to be wicked according to their own passions. Hence, if a woman has
      a dear friend other than one of her nearest kinsfolk, she must speak with
      him in secret if she would speak long with him; for a woman&rsquo;s honour is
      attacked, whether she love virtuously or viciously, since people judge
      only from appearances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Geburon, &ldquo;when a secret of that kind is revealed, people think
      far worse of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I grant you that,&rdquo; said Longarine; &ldquo;and so it is best not to love at
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We appeal from that sentence,&rdquo; said Dagoucin, &ldquo;for, did we believe the
      ladies to be without love, we would fain be ourselves without life. I
      speak of those who live but to win love: and, even if they secure it not,
      yet the hope of it sustains them and prompts them to do a thousand
      honourable deeds, until old age changes their fair sufferings to other
      pains. But, did we think that ladies were without love, it were needful we
      should turn traders instead of soldiers, and instead of winning fame,
      think only of hea&rsquo;ping up riches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would say, then,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;that, were there no women, we should
      all be dastards, as though we had no courage save such as they put into
      us. But I am of quite the opposite opinion, and hold that nothing weakens
      a man&rsquo;s courage so much as to consort with women or love them too much.
      For this reason the Jews would not suffer a man to go to the war within a
      year after his marriage, lest love for his wife should draw him back from
      the dangers that he ought to seek.&rdquo; (5)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     5  See <i>Deuteronomy</i> xx. 5, 6, 7; and the comments thereon
     of Rabelais (book iii. ch. vi.).&mdash;M.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I consider that law,&rdquo; said Saffredent, &ldquo;to have been without reason, for
      nothing will more readily make a man leave his home than marriage. The war
      without is not harder of endurance than the war within; and I think that,
      to make men desirous of going into foreign lands instead of lingering by
      their hearths, it were only needful to marry them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; said Ennasuite, &ldquo;that marriage takes from them the care of
      their houses; for they trust in their wives, and for their own part think
      only of winning fame, feeling certain that their wives will give due heed
      to the profit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However that may be,&rdquo; replied Saffredent, &ldquo;I am glad that you are of my
      opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;you are not discussing what is chiefly to be
      considered, and that is why the gentleman, who was the cause of all the
      misfortune, did not as quickly die of grief as she who was innocent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nomerfide replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Twas because women love more truly than men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said Simontault, &ldquo;&lsquo;twas because the jealousy and spitefulness of
      women make them die without knowing the reason, whereas men are led by
      their prudence to inquire into the truth of the matter. When this has been
      learnt through their sound sense, they display their courage, as this
      gentleman did; for, as soon as he understood the reason of his
      sweetheart&rsquo;s misfortune, he showed how truly he loved her and did not
      spare his own life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet,&rdquo; said Ennasuite, &ldquo;she died of true love, for her steadfast and loyal
      heart could not endure to be so deceived.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was her jealousy,&rdquo; said Simontault, &ldquo;which would not yield to reason,
      so that she believed evil of her lover of which he was not guilty at all.
      Moreover, her death was matter of necessity, for she could not prevent it,
      whilst her lover&rsquo;s death was voluntary, after he had recognised his own
      wrongdoing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still,&rdquo; said Nomerfide, &ldquo;the love must needs be great that causes such
      deep sorrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have no fear of it,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;for you will never die of that kind of
      fever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor,&rdquo; said Nomerfide, &ldquo;will you ever kill yourself after recognising your
      error.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Parlamente, who suspected that the dispute was being carried on at
      her own expense, said, laughing&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis enough that two persons should have died of love, without two others
      fighting for the same cause. And there is the last bell sounding for
      vespers, which will have us gone whether you be willing or not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By her advice the whole company then rose and went to hear vespers, not
      forgetting in their fervent prayers the souls of those true lovers, for
      whom, also, the monks, of their charity, said a <i>De profundis</i>. As
      long as supper lasted there was no talk save of the Lady du Vergier, and
      then, when they had spent a little time together, they withdrew to their
      several apartments, and so brought to an end the Seventh Day.

      PROLOGUE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When morning was come they inquired whether their bridge (1) were being
      well advanced, and found that it might be finished in two or three days.
      These were not welcome tidings to some among the company, for they would
      gladly have had the work last a longer time, so as to prolong the
      happiness that they enjoyed in this pleasant mode of life. Finding,
      however, that only two or three such days were left, they resolved to turn
      them to account, and begged the Lady Oisille to give them their spiritual
      nourishment as had been her wont. This she forthwith did, but she detained
      them longer than usual, for before setting forth she desired to finish
      reading the canonical writings of St. John; and so well did she acquit
      herself of this, that it seemed as if the Holy Spirit in all His love and
      sweetness spoke by her mouth. Glowing with this heavenly flame, they went
      to hear high mass, and afterwards dined together, again speaking of the
      past day, and doubting whether they could make another as fair.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  The allusion is to the bridge over the Gave spoken of in
     the General Prologue (<i>ante</i>, vol. i. p. 25-6).&mdash;M.
</pre>
    <p>
      In order to set about it, they retired to their own rooms until it was
      time to repair to their Chamber of Accounts on the Board of Green Grass,
      where they found the monks already arrived and in their places.
    </p>
    <p>
      When all were seated, the question was put, who should begin; and
      Saffredent said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did me the honour to have me begin on two days. Methinks we should
      act wrongly towards the ladies if one of them did not also begin on two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It were then needful,&rdquo; said the Lady Oisille, &ldquo;either that we should
      continue here for a great while, or else that a gentleman and a lady of
      the company should forego the beginning of a day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my part,&rdquo; said Dagoucin, &ldquo;had I been chosen, I would have given my
      place to Saffredent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I,&rdquo; said Nomerfide, &ldquo;to Parlamente, for I have been so wont to serve
      that I know not how to command.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this all agreed, and Parlamente thus began&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ladies, the days that are past have been filled with so many tales of
      wisdom, that I would beg you to fill this one with the greatest (yet most
      real) follies that we can remember. So, to lead the way, I will begin.&rdquo;

      <i>TALE LXXI</i>.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>A saddler&rsquo;s wife, who was grievously sick, was made whole
     and recovered the power of speech, which for the space of
     two days site had lost, on seeing her husband holding his
     serving-maid too familiarly on the bed whilst she herself
     was drawing to her end</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      In the town of Amboise there lived one Brimbaudier, (1) saddler to the
      Queen of Navarre, and a man whose colour of feature showed him to be by
      nature rather a servant of Bacchus than a priest of Diana. He had married
      a virtuous woman who controlled his household very discreetly, and with
      whom he was well content.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  Boaistuau gives the name as Bruribandier, and Gruget
     transforms it into Borribaudier. M, Pifteau, after examining
     the MSS., is doubtful whether Brimbaudier is the correct
     reading. Bromardier, which in old French meant a tippler
     (Ducange, <i>Briemardum</i>), would have been an appropriate name
     for the individual referred to.&mdash;Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      One day it was told him that his good wife was sick and in great danger,
      at which tidings he was in the greatest trouble imaginable. He went with
      all speed to her aid, and found her so low, poor woman, that she had more
      need of a confessor than a doctor. Thereupon he made the most pitiful
      lamentation that could be, but to represent it well &lsquo;twere needful to
      speak thickly as he did, (2) and better still to paint one&rsquo;s face like
      his.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     2  Curiously enough, the transcriber of MS. No. 1520
     attempts to give some idea of the husband&rsquo;s pronunciation by
     transforming all his r&rsquo;s into l&rsquo;s. Here is an example: &ldquo;Je
     pelz ma povle femme, que fesai-ze, moi malhureux?... M&rsquo;amie
     je me meuls, je suis pis que tlepassé... je ne sçai que
     faize,&rdquo; &amp;c.&mdash;L.
</pre>
    <p>
      When he had done all that he could for her, she asked for the cross, and
      it was brought. On seeing this, the good man flung himself upon a bed in
      despair, crying and saying in his thick speech&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah God! I am losing my poor wife! What shall I do, unhappy man that I
      am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After uttering many such complaints, he perceived that there was no one in
      the room but a young servant-maid, passably fair and buxom, and he called
      to her in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sweetheart,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am dying. I am more than dead to see your
      mistress dying in this manner. I know not what to do or say, except that I
      commend myself to you, and beg you to care for my house and my children.
      Take therefore the keys from my side, and order the household, for I
      myself can attend to nothing more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The poor girl had pity on him and comforted him, begging him not to
      despair, so that, if she must lose her mistress, she might not also lose
      her good master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sweetheart,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;&lsquo;tis all of no avail, for I am indeed dying.
      See yourself how cold my face is; bring your cheeks close to mine and warm
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this he laid his hand upon her breast. She tried to make some
      difficulty, but he begged her to have no fear, since they must indeed see
      each other more closely. And speaking in this wise, he took her in his
      arms and threw her upon the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then his wife, whose only company was the cross and the holy water, and
      who had not spoken for two days, began to cry out as loudly as her feeble
      voice enabled her&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! ah! ah! I am not dead yet!&rdquo; And threatening them with her hand, she
      repeated&mdash;&ldquo;Villain! monster! I am not dead yet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On hearing her voice, the husband and maid rose up, but she was in such a
      rage against them that her anger consumed the catarrhal humour that had
      prevented her from speaking, and she poured upon them all the abuse that
      she could think of. And from that hour she began to mend, though not
      without often reproaching her husband for the little love he bore her. (3)
    </p>

     3  This story was imitated by Noël du Fail de La Hérissaye
     in his <i>Contes d&rsquo;Eutrapel</i> (ch. v.<i> De la Goutte</i>), where
     the hero of the incident is called Glaume Esnaut de
     Tremeril. &ldquo;It is said,&rdquo; writes Du Fail, &ldquo;that the wife of
     that rascal Glaume of Tremeril when at the point of death,
     on seeing Glaume too familiar with her serving-woman,
     recovered her senses, saying, &lsquo;Ah! wicked man, I am not yet
     so low as you thought. By God&rsquo;s grace, mistress baggage, you
     shall go forth at once.&rsquo;&rdquo; Curiously enough, the 1585 edition
     of the <i>Contes d&rsquo;Eutrapel</i> was printed at Rennes for Noël
     Glame, virtually the same name as Glaume.&mdash;M.

    <p>
      &ldquo;By this you see, ladies, the hypocrisy of men, and how a little
      consolation will make them forget their sorrow for their wives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;that he had not heard that such was the
      best remedy his wife could have? Since his kindly treatment availed not to
      cure her, he wished to try whether the opposite would prove any better,
      and the trial was a very fortunate one. But I marvel that you who are a
      woman should have shown how the constitution of your sex is brought to
      amendment rather by foul means than by fair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without doubt,&rdquo; said Longarine, &ldquo;behaviour of that kind would make me
      rise not merely from my bed, but from a grave such as that yonder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what wrong did he do her,&rdquo; asked Saffre-dent, &ldquo;by comforting himself
      when he thought that she was dead? It is known that the marriage-tie lasts
      only through life, and that when this is ended it is loosed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;loosed from oath and bond, but a good heart is never
      loosed from love. The husband you have told us of was indeed quick to
      forget his grief, since he could not wait until his wife had breathed her
      last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I think strangest of all,&rdquo; said Nomerfide, &ldquo;is that, when death and
      the cross were before his eyes, he should not have lost all desire to
      offend against God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A brave argument!&rdquo; said Simontault. &ldquo;You would therefore not be surprised
      to see a man act wantonly provided he were a good distance from the church
      and cemetery?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may laugh at me as much as you please,&rdquo; said Nomerfide; &ldquo;nevertheless
      the contemplation of death must greatly chill a heart, however young it
      may be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should indeed be of the same opinion as yourself,&rdquo; said Dagoucin, &ldquo;if I
      had not heard a Princess say the opposite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In other words.&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;she told some story about it. If it be
      so, I will give you my place that you may relate it to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Dagoucin began as follows:&mdash;

      <i>TALE LXXII</i>.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>Whilst engaged in the last deed of charity, the shrouding
     of a dead body, a monk did also engage with a nun in the
     deeds of the flesh, and made her big with child</i>. (1)
</pre>
    <p>
      In one of the finest towns of France after Paris there stood an hospital
      (2) richly endowed&mdash;namely, with a Prioress and fifteen or sixteen
      nuns, while in another building there was a Prior and seven or eight
      monks. Every day the monks said mass, but the nuns only their paternosters
      and the Hours of Our Lady, for they were occupied in tending the sick.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  Gruget first printed this tale, which was not given by
     Boaistuau.&mdash;L.

     2  It is impossible to say what town and hospital Margaret
     here refers to. Lyons is the scene of the latter part of the
     story; and we are inclined to think that the earlier
     incidents may have occurred at Dijon, where there was a
     famous hospital under ecclesiastical management, founded by
     Eudes III., seventh Duke of Burgundy.&mdash;L. and Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      One day it chanced that a poor man died, and the nuns, being all assembled
      with him, after giving him every remedy for his health, sent for one of
      their monks to confess him. Then, finding that he was growing weaker, they
      gave him the extreme unction, after which he little by little lost the
      power of speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as he was a long time in passing away, and it seemed that he could
      still hear, the nuns continued speaking to him with the most comforting
      words they knew, until at last they grew weary, and, finding that night
      was come and that it was late, retired one after another to rest. Thus, to
      shroud the body, there remained only one of the youngest of the nuns, with
      a monk whom she feared more than the Prior or any other, by reason of the
      severity that he displayed in both speech and life.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had duly uttered their Hours in the poor man&rsquo;s ear, they
      perceived that he was dead, and thereupon laid him out. Whilst engaged on
      this last deed of charity, the monk began to speak of the wretchedness of
      life, and the blessedness of death; and in such discourse they continued
      until after midnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor girl listened attentively to the monk&rsquo;s pious utterances, looking
      at him the while with tears in her eyes; and so pleasing were these to him
      that, whilst speaking of the life to come, he began to embrace her as
      though he longed to bear her away in his arms to Paradise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor girl, listening to his discourse and deeming him the most pious
      of the community, ventured not to say him nay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perceiving this, the wicked monk, whilst still speaking of God,
      accomplished with her the work which the devil suddenly put into their
      hearts&mdash;for before there had been no question of such a thing. He
      assured her, however, that secret sin was not imputed to men by God, and
      that two persons who had no ties, could do no wrong in this manner, when
      no scandal came of it; and, to avoid all scandal, he told her to be
      careful to confess to none but himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they parted each from the other, she going first. And as she passed
      through a chapel dedicated to Our Lady, she was minded to make her prayer
      as was her wont. But when she began with the words, &ldquo;Mary, Virgin,&rdquo; she
      remembered that she had lost the title of virginity not through force or
      love, but through foolish fear; and she began to weep so bitterly that it
      seemed as if her heart must break.
    </p>
    <p>
      The monk, hearing the sighing from a distance, suspected her repentance,
      which might make him lose his delight, and to prevent this, he came and,
      finding her prostrate before the image, began to rebuke her harshly,
      telling her that if she had any scruples of conscience she should confess
      herself to him, and that she need not so act again unless she desired; for
      she might behave in either way without sin. The foolish nun, thinking to
      make atonement to God, confessed herself to the monk; but in respect of
      penance he swore to her that she did no sin in loving him, and that holy
      water would suffice to wash away such a peccadillo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Believing in him more than in God, she again some time afterwards yielded
      to him, and so became big with child. At this she was in deep grief, and
      entreated the Prioress to have the monk turned away from his monastery,
      saying that she knew him to be so crafty that he would not fail to seduce
      her. The Abbess and the Prior, who understood each other, laughed at her,
      saying that she was big enough to defend herself against a man, and that
      the monk she spoke of was too virtuous to do such a deed.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, urged by the prickings of her conscience, she craved license to
      go to Rome, for she thought that, by confessing her sin at the Pope&rsquo;s
      feet, she might recover her virginity. This the Prior and Prioress very
      readily granted her, for they were more willing that she should become a
      pilgrim contrary to the rules of her order, than be shut up in the convent
      with her present scruples. They feared also that in her despair she might
      denounce the life that was led among them, and so gave her money for her
      journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      But God brought it to pass that when she came to Lyons, my lady the
      Duchess of Alençon, afterwards Queen of Navarre, being one evening after
      vespers in the roodloft of the church of St. John, whither she came
      secretly to perform a novena with three or four of her women, (3) heard
      someone mounting the stairway whilst she was kneeling before the crucifix.
      By the light of the lamp she saw it was a nun, and in order that she might
      hear her devotions, the Duchess thereupon withdrew to the corner of the
      altar. The nun, who believed herself to be alone, knelt down and, beating
      her breast, began weeping so sorrowfully that it was piteous to hear her;
      and all the while she cried naught but this&mdash;&ldquo;Alas! my God, take pity
      on this poor sinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     3  See <i>ante</i>, Tale LXV., note i.
</pre>
    <p>
      The Duchess, wishing to learn what it meant, went up to her and said,
      &ldquo;Dear heart, what ails you, and whence do you come, and what brings you to
      this place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The poor nun, who did not know her, replied, &ldquo;Ah, sweet, my woe is such
      that I have no help but in God; and I pray that He may bring me to speak
      with the Duchess of Alençon. To her alone will I tell the matter, for I am
      sure that, if it be possible, she will set it right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear heart,&rdquo; then said the Duchess, &ldquo;you may speak to me as you would to
      her, for I am one of her nearest friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; said the nun; &ldquo;she alone must know my secret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the Duchess told her that she might speak freely, since she had
      indeed found her whom she sought. Forthwith the poor woman threw herself
      at her feet, and, after she had wept, related what you have heard
      concerning her hapless fortune. The Duchess consoled her so well, that
      whilst she took not from her everlasting repentance for her sin, she put
      from her mind the journeying to Rome, and then sent her back to her priory
      with letters to the Bishop of the place to have that shameful monk turned
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have this story from the Duchess herself, and from it you may see,
      ladies, that Nomerfide&rsquo;s prescription is not good for all, since these
      persons fell into lewdness even while touching and laying out the dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Twas a device,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;that methinks no man ever used before, to
      talk of death and engage in the deeds of life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis no deed of life,&rdquo; said Oisille, &ldquo;to sin, for it is well known that
      sin begets death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may be sure,&rdquo; said Saffredent, &ldquo;that these poor folk gave no thought
      to any such theology; but just as the daughters of Lot made their father
      drunk so that the human race might be preserved, so these persons wished
      to repair what death had spoiled, and to replace the dead body by a new
      one. I therefore can see no harm in the matter except the tears of the
      poor nun, who was always weeping and always returning to the cause of her
      tears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have known many of the same kind,&rdquo; said Hircan, &ldquo;who wept for their
      sins and laughed at their pleasures both together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I know whom you mean,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;and their laughter has
      lasted so great a while that &lsquo;twere time the tears should begin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said Hircan. &ldquo;The tragedy that has begun with laughter is not
      ended yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To change the subject,&rdquo; said Parlamente, &ldquo;it seems to me that Dagoucin
      departed from our purpose. We were to tell only merry tales, and his was
      very piteous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said,&rdquo; replied Dagoucin, &ldquo;that you would only tell of follies, and I
      think that herein I have not been lacking. But, that we may hear a more
      pleasant story, I give my vote to Nomerfide, in the hope that she will
      make amends for my error.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have indeed,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;a story ready which is worthy to follow
      yours; for it speaks of monks and death. So I pray you give good heed.&rdquo;
     </p>

      THE SUPPOSED NARRATORS OF THE <i>HEPTAMERON</i> TALES.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In his introductory essay to this translation of the <i>Heptameron</i>,
      Mr. George Saintsbury has called attention to the researches of various
      commentators who have laboured to identify the supposed narrators of Queen
      Margaret&rsquo;s tales. As it may be fairly assumed that the setting of the work
      is pure invention on the Queen&rsquo;s part, the researches in question can
      scarcely serve any useful purpose. Still they appear to have had
      considerable attraction for several erudite editors, whose opinions,
      occasionally alluded to in our notes, we will here briefly summarise for
      the information of those whom the matter may interest:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      OISILLE, a widow lady of long experience, is supposed by Messrs. de Lincy,
      Lacroix, Génin, Frank, de Montaiglon and Miss Mary Robinson to be Louise
      of Savoy. In some MSS. the name is written Osyle, the anagram of <i>Loyse</i>,
      in which fashion Louise was spelt in old French. It may be pointed out, <i>en
      passant</i>, that Brantôme&rsquo;s grandmother, the Sénéchale of Poitou, whose
      connection with the <i>Heptameron</i> is recorded, was also named Louise
      (see ante, vol. i. p. lxxxii.).
    </p>
    <p>
      PARLAMENTE, wife of Hircan, is supposed by the same commentators to be
      Queen Margaret herself; this is assumed mainly because the views which
      Parlamente expresses on religion, philosophy, men and women, are generally
      in accord with those which the Queen is known to have professed.
    </p>
    <p>
      HIRCAN, in M. de Lincy&rsquo;s opinion, might be the Duke of Alençon, Margaret&rsquo;s
      first husband. Messrs. Frank and Mont-aiglon, following M. Lacroix, prefer
      to identify him as Henry d&rsquo;Albret, King of Navarre. They conjecture the
      name of Hircan to be derived from Ilanricus, a not uncommon fashion of
      spelling Henricus. It might, however, simply come from <i>hircus</i>, a
      he-goat, for Hircan is a man of gross, sensual tastes.
    </p>
    <p>
      LONGARINE, a young widow, is supposed by M. de Lincy to be Blanche de
      Chastillon, <i>née</i> de Tournon (concerning whom see <i>ante</i>, vol.
      i. p. 84, n. 7, and p. 120 <i>et seq</i>.; vol. iv. p. 144, n. 2; and vol.
      v. p. 25, n. 2). M. Frank, however, thinks she is Aimée Motier de la
      Fayette, lady of <i>Longray</i>, widow of Francis de Silly, Bailiff of
      Caen, and <i>gouvernante</i> to Queen Margaret&rsquo;s daughter, Jane of
      Navarre. Miss Robinson shares this opinion, but M. de Montaiglon thinks
      that <i>Longarine</i> would rather be Aimée Motier de la Fayette&rsquo;s
      daughter Frances, married to Frederic d&rsquo;Almenesches, of one of the
      branches of the house of Foix.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIMONTAULT (occasionally <i>Symontaut</i>), a young knight, is thought by
      M. de Lincy to be Henry d&rsquo;Albret, Margaret&rsquo;s second husband, who was of an
      extremely amorous disposition, and much younger than herself. Messrs.
      Frank and de Montaiglon, however, fancy <i>Simontault</i> to have been
      Francis, Baron de Bourdeilles, father of Brantôme. It is admitted,
      however, that if this be the case, it is curious that Brantôme should not
      have alluded to it in any of his writings, whereas he does speak both of
      his mother and of his grandmother in connection with the <i>Heptameron</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      ENNASUITE (occasionally <i>Ennasuitte</i> or <i>Ennasuicte</i>, and in
      some MSS. <i>Emarsuite</i>), is supposed by Messrs. de Lincy, Frank, and
      de Montaiglon to be Anne de Vivonne, wife of Francis de Bourdeilles and
      mother of Brantôme (see ante, vol. iv. p. 144, n. 2). It is pointed out
      that the name may be transformed into the three words <i>Anne et suite</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      DAGOUCIN, a young gentleman, is thought by M. Frank to be Nicholas Dangu
      (see ante, vol. i. p. 20, n. 4, and p. 40, n. 3), who became Chancellor to
      the King of Navarre. M. Lacroix, however, fancies this personage to be a
      Count d&rsquo;Agoust.
    </p>
    <p>
      GEBURON, apparently an elderly man, would in M. Frank&rsquo;s opinion be the
      Seigneur de Burye, a captain of the Italian wars to whom Brantôme (his
      cousin-german) alludes in his writings. The name of de Burye is also found
      in a list of the personages present at Queen Margaret&rsquo;s funeral. M. de
      Montaiglon shares M. Frank&rsquo;s views.
    </p>
    <p>
      NOMERFIDE, so M. de Lincy suggests, may have been the famous Frances de
      Foix, Countess of Chateaubriand; but M. Frank opines that she is a
      Demoiselle de Fimarcon or Fiédmarcon (Lat. <i>Feudimarco</i>), who in 1525
      married John de Montpczat, called &ldquo;Captain Carbon,&rdquo; one of the exquisites
      of the famous Field of the cloth of gold. Miss Robinson, however, fancies
      that Nomerfide is Isabel d&rsquo;Albret, sister of Margaret&rsquo;s second husband,
      and wife of René de Rohan.
    </p>
    <p>
      SAFFREDENT, so M. de Lincy thinks, may be Admiral de Bonnivet; M. Frank
      suggests John de Montpezat; and Miss Robinson René de Rohan, who, after
      his father Peter de Rohan-Gié (husband of Rolandine, see <i>ante</i>, vol.
      iii., Tale XXI, notes 2 and 15), had been killed at Pavia, was for some
      years entrusted to Queen Margaret&rsquo;s care. As Miss Robinson points out, <i>Saffredent</i>
      literally means greedy tooth or sweet tooth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who may be desirous of studying and comparing these various attempts
      at identification, will find all the evidence and arguments of any value
      set forth in the writings of M. Frank, M. de Montaiglon and Miss Robinson,
      which are specified in the Bibliography annexed to this appendix.&mdash;Ed.

      BIBLIOGRAPHY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Fourteen MS. copies of the <i>Heptameron</i> are known to exist. Twelve of
      these are at the Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris, one is at the town library
      of Orleans, and one in the Vatican library. We also have some record of
      four other copies which were in private libraries at the end of the last
      century.
    </p>
    <p>
      The twelve MSS. at the Bibliothèque Nationale are the following:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      I. (No. 1511 in the catalogue). A folio volume bound in red morocco,
      bearing the Béthune arms. This MS. is on ruled paper, and only one leaf,
      the last, is missing.
    </p>
    <p>
      II. (No. 1512). A small folio, calf gilt, 350 leaves, from Colbert&rsquo;s
      library. The handwriting is that of the middle of the sixteeenth century,
      and is the same throughout; the last page bearing the signature &ldquo;Doulcet.&rdquo;
       This supplied the text followed in the present translation.

      III. (No. 1513). A small folio, half-bound in red morocco, stamped with
      King Louis Philippe&rsquo;s monogram. It contains only twenty-eight of the
      tales.
    </p>
    <p>
      IV. (No. 1514). A large quarto, calf, from the De Mesmes library. Contains
      only thirty-four of the tales.
    </p>
    <p>
      V. (No. 1515). A small folio from Colbert&rsquo;s library, bound in calf, in
      Groslier&rsquo;s style. The text is complete, but there are numerous interlinear
      and marginal corrections and additions, in the same handwriting as MS.
      VII.
    </p>
    <p>
      VI. (Nos. 1516 to 1519). Four quarto vols., red morocco, Béthune arms. The
      first prologue is deficient, as is also the last leaf of tale lxxi.
    </p>
    <p>
      VII. (No. 1520). A folio vol., calf and red morocco, stamped with
      fleurs-de-lys and the monogram of Louis XVIII. This MS. on stout ruled
      paper, in a beautiful italic handwriting of the end of the sixteenth
      century, is complete. Unfortunately Queen Margaret&rsquo;s phraseology has been
      considerably modified, though, on the other hand, the copyist has inserted
      a large number of different readings, as marginal notes, which render his
      work of great value. It is frequently quoted in the present translation.
    </p>
    <p>
      VIII. (No. 1523). A folio vol., calf, from the De La Marre library. The
      first two leaves are deficient, and the text ends with the fifth tale of
      Day IV.
    </p>
    <p>
      IX. (No. 1522). A small folio, bound in parchment, from the De La Marre
      library. Only the tales of the first four days are complete, and on folio
      259 begins a long poem called Les Prisons, the work probably of William
      Filandrier, whom Queen Margaret protected. On the first folio of the
      volume is the inscription, in sixteenth-century handwriting: <i>Pour ma
      sour Marie Philander</i>. The poem <i>Les Prisons</i> is quoted on pp.
      xxxviii.-ix. vol. i. of the present work. It concludes with an epitaph on
      Margaret, dated 1549.
    </p>
    <p>
      X. (No. 1524). A folio vol. from Colbert&rsquo;s library, bound in red and
      yellow morocco, on which is painted, on a blue ground, a vine laden with
      grapes twining round the trunk of a tree. On either side and in gold
      letters is the device, <i>Sin e doppo la morte</i> (until and after
      death). Following the title-page, on which the work is called &ldquo;The
      Decameron of the most high and most illustrious Princess, Madame Margaret
      of France,&rdquo; is a curious preface signed &ldquo;Adrian de Thou,&rdquo; and dated
      &ldquo;Paris, August 8, 1553.&rdquo; This Adrian de Thou, Lord of Hierville and canon
      of Notre Dame de Paris, counsellor and clerk of the Paris Parliament, was
      the fourth son of Augustine de Thou and uncle to James Augustus de Thou,
      the historian. He died in October 1570. His MS. of the <i>Heptameron</i>,
      a most beautiful specimen of caligraphy, contains a long table of various
      readings and obscure passages; this was consulted in preparing the text
      for the present translation. The titles to the tales have also been
      borrowed from this MS.; they were composed by De Thou himself, and figure
      in no other MS. copy.
    </p>
    <p>
      XI. (No. 1525). A small folio, calf, from Colbert&rsquo;s library, very
      incomplete and badly written, but containing the <i>Miroir de Jésu Crist
      crucifié</i>, the last poem Queen Margaret composed (see <i>ante</i>, vol.
      i. p. lxxxvi.).
    </p>
    <p>
      XII. (No. 2155). A small quarto, red morocco, from the library of Mazarin,
      whose escutcheon has been cut off. The text, which is complete and
      correct, excepting that a portion of the prologue has been accidentally
      transposed, is followed by an epitaph on the Queen. The handwriting
      throughout is that of the end of the sixteenth century.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other MSS. of the <i>Heptameron</i> are the following:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      XIII. (Orleans town library, No. 352). A folio vol. of 440 pp. It is
      doubtful whether this MS. is of the sixteenth or seventeenth century. It
      bears the title <i>L&rsquo;Heptaméron des Nouvelles, &amp;c</i>. There are
      numerous deficiencies in the text.
    </p>
    <p>
      XIV. (Vatican library, No. 929; from the library of Queen Christina of
      Sweden). A folio vol., calf, 95 leaves, handwriting of the end of the
      sixteenth century. This only contains fifteen of the stories.
    </p>
    <p>
      XV. (present possessor unknown). A folio vol., red morocco; text (ending
      with tale lxix. ) in sixteenth-century handwriting, with illuminated
      initial letters to each tale. <i>Catalogue des livres de feue Mme. la
      Comtesse de Verrue</i>, Paris, G. Martin, 1737.
    </p>
    <p>
      XVI. (possessor unknown). MS. supposed to be the original, a large folio,
      handwriting of the period, antique binding, containing the seventy-two
      tales. <i>Catalogue des livres, &amp;c., du cabinet de M. Filheul, &amp;c.</i>,
      Paris, Chardin, 1779, pp. xxi. and 280.
    </p>
    <p>
      XVII. (possessor unknown). A folio vol., blue morocco, gilt. No. 1493 in
      the catalogue of the <i>Bibliothèque de Simon Bernard, chez Barrois</i>,
      Paris, 1734; and No. 213 in a <i>Catalogue de manuscrits intéressants qui
      seront vendus... en la maison de M. Gueret, notaire</i>, Paris, Debure
      fils jeune, 1776.
    </p>
    <p>
      XVIII. (possessor unknown). A folio vol., blue morocco, gilt, stamped with
      the arms of France, from the Randon de Boisset library; the seventy-two
      tales complete, a very fine copy. <i>Catalogue des livres de la
      bibliothèqzie de l&rsquo;Abbé Rive</i>, Marseilles, 1793. (This MS. should not
      be confounded with No. xvii. See L. J. Hubaud&rsquo;s <i>Dissertation sur les
      Contes de la Reine de Navarre</i>, Marseilles, 1850.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The following are the editions of Queen Margaret&rsquo;s tales issued from the
      press from the sixteenth century to the present time. The list has been
      prepared with great care, and we believe it to be as complete a one as can
      be furnished; it includes several editions not mentioned in Brunet&rsquo;s
      Manual:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      I. <i>Histoires des Amans Fortunez dédiées à très illustre princesse, Mme.
      Marguerite de Bourbon, etc., par Pierre Boaistuau, dit Launoy</i>, Paris,
      1558, 40. The authorisation to print and publish was accorded to Vincent
      Sertenas, and the work was issued by three different booksellers; some
      copies bearing the name of Gilles Robinot, others that of Jean Cavyller,
      and others that of Gilles Gilles.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, the first edition of the Queen&rsquo;s work, contains only sixty-seven of
      the tales, which are not divided into days or printed in their proper
      sequence; the prologues, moreover, are deficient, and all the bold
      passages on religious and philosophical questions, &amp;c, in the
      conversational matter following the stories, are suppressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      II. <i>L&rsquo;Heptaméron des Nouvelles de tris illustre et très excellente
      Princesse Marguerite de Valois, Royne de Navarre, &amp;c., dédié à très
      illustre et très vertueuse Princesse Jeanne, Royne de Navarre, par Claude
      Gruget, parisien</i>, Paris, Vincent Certena, or Jean Caveillier, 1559.
    </p>
    <p>
      This contains all the Queen&rsquo;s tales excepting Nos. xi., xliv., and xlvi.,
      which Gruget replaced by others, probably written by himself. The other
      stories are placed in their proper order, but none of the names and
      passages suppressed by Boaistuau are restored. The phraseology of the
      MSS., moreover, is still further modified and polished.
    </p>
    <p>
      The text adopted by Boaistuau and Gruget was followed, with a few
      additional modifications, in all the editions issued during the later
      years of the sixteenth century. Most of these are badly printed and
      contain numerous typographical errors:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      III. <i>L&rsquo;Heptamêron des Nouvelles, &amp;c</i>. Reprint of Gruget&rsquo;s
      edition, sold by Vincent Sertenas, Gilles Robinot &amp; Gilles Gille, and
      printed by Benoist Prévost, Paris, 1560.
    </p>
    <p>
      IV. <i>L&rsquo;Heptamêron des Nouvelles, &amp;c</i>., 1560, 16mo. (No
      bookseller&rsquo;s or printer&rsquo;s name appears in this edition. )
    </p>
    <p>
      V. <i>L&rsquo;Heptamêron, &amp;c</i>. (Gruget). Guill. Rouillé, Lyons, 1561,
      small 12mo; Gilles Gilles, Paris, 1561, 16mo.
    </p>
    <p>
      VI. The same. Norment &amp; Bruneau, and Gilles Gilles, Paris, 1567, 16mo.
    </p>
    <p>
      VII. The same. Louys Cloquemin, Lyons, 1572, 16mo (reprinted in 1578 and
      1581).
    </p>
    <p>
      VIII. The same. Michel de Roigny, Paris, 1574, 16mo (round letters).
    </p>
    <p>
      IX. The same. Gab. Buon, Paris, 1581, 16mo.
    </p>
    <p>
      X. The same. Abel L&rsquo;Angelier, Paris, 1581, 18mo.
    </p>
    <p>
      XI. The same. Jean Osmont, Rouen, 1598, 578 pp., sin. 12mo (good type).
    </p>
    <p>
      XII. The same. Romain Beauvais, Rouen, 1598, 589 pp. 12mo.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the seventeenth century the <i>Heptameron</i> was frequently reprinted,
      Gruget&rsquo;s text, with a few changes, being still followed until 1698, when
      it occurred to some obscure literary man to put the tales into so-called
      <i>beau langage</i>. At the same time the title of <i>Heptameron</i>,
      devised by Gruget, was discarded (see post, No. XVI.).
    </p>
    <p>
      XIII. <i>L&rsquo;Heptaméron</i>, &amp;c., printed by Ch. Chappellein, Paris,
      1607, 18mo.
    </p>
    <p>
      XIV. The same. <i>Sur Pimprimé à Paris</i>, J. Bessin (Holland), 1615, sm.
      l2mo (reprinted in 1698, 2. vols. 12mo).
    </p>
    <p>
      XV. The same. David du Petit-Val, Rouen, 1625, 12mo.
    </p>
    <p>
      XVI. <i>Contes et Nouvelles de Marguerite de Valois, Reine de Navarre, mis
      en beau langage</i>. Gallet, Amsterdam, 1698, 2 vols, sm. 8vo. This
      edition is valued not for its <i>beau langage</i>, but for the copperplate
      engravings illustrating it. These are coarsely executed, and are
      attributed to Roman de Hooge, but do not bear his name. A reprint of the
      edition appeared at Amsterdam in 1700.
    </p>
    <p>
      XVII. The same. Gallet, Amsterdam, 1708, 2 vols. sm. 8vo. Virtually a
      reprint, but with several of the Roman de Hooge plates deficient, and
      replaced by others signed Harrewyn.
    </p>
    <p>
      XVIII. The same. La Haye (Chartres), 1733, 2 vols. sm. 12mo.
    </p>
    <p>
      XIX. The same. Londres, 1744, 2 vols. 12mo.
    </p>
    <p>
      XX. Heptaméron Français, ou les Nouvelles de Marguerite, Reine de Navarre;
      chez la Nouvelle Société Typographique, Berne, 1780-1, 3 vols. 8vo. On
      some copies the title is simply, Nouvelles de Marguerite, etc., Berne,
      1781; on others Béat Louis Walthard is designated as the publisher.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this edition were executed the copperplate engravings, designed by
      Freudenberg and Dunker, which illustrate the present translation. It was
      at first intended to issue the work in parts, but after parts i. and ii.
      had been published (at 4 livres each) the project was abandoned. A few
      copies of these two parts are in existence; they bear the date 1778.
      Freudenberg began his designs in the previous year, and finished them in
      1780.
    </p>
    <p>
      This edition is greatly prized for its illustrations; the text, however,
      largely modified by Jean Rodolphe de Sinner, is without value. The work
      was reissued at Paris in 1784 (8 vols, in 8vo, some copies 18mo), at Berne
      in 1792, and again in Paris in 1807 (8 vols. 18mo).
    </p>
    <p>
      The following new editions of the <i>Heptameron</i> have appeared during
      the present century:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      XXI. <i>Contes et Nouvelles de Marguerite, &amp;c</i>. Dauthereau, Paris,
      1828, 5 vols. 32mo. (Collection des romans français et étrangers.)
    </p>
    <p>
      XXII. <i>L&rsquo;Heptamêron, ou Histoire des Amants fortunés, &amp;c, ancien
      texte publié par C. Gruget.., revu, corrigé et publié avec des notes,
      &amp;c., par le bibliophile Jacob</i>. Gosselin (Bibliothèque d&rsquo;Élite),
      Paris, 1841, 12mo. In this edition the Bibliophile Jacob (M. P. Lacroix)
      but slightly modified Gruget&rsquo;s text, and his annotation was comparatively
      insignificant. His work was reproduced in a volume of the <i>Panthéon
      Littéraire: Les vieux Conteurs français</i>, Paris, 1841, 1. 8vo. (double
      cols.).
    </p>
    <p>
      XXIII. <i>Heptaméron des Nouvelles de... Margtierile d&rsquo;Angouléme...
      publiée sur les manuscrits par la Société des Bibliophiles Français</i>
      (Le Roux de Lincy, editor), Paris, 1853-4, 3 vols. sm. 18mo.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this edition the real text of the tales was printed for the first time,
      M. de Lincy having carefully examined the best MSS. for this purpose. The
      present English translation is based upon his work. Copies of the
      &ldquo;Bibliophiles Français&rdquo; edition, which contains a portrait of the Queen, a
      facsimile of a miniature, and an engraving showing her arms and device,
      cannot be purchased, when in fair condition, for less than £6 in Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      XXIV. <i>L&rsquo;Heptaméron des Nouvelles, etc.... avec des notes et une notice
      par P. L. Jacob, Bibliophile</i> (Paul Lacroix). Adolphe Delahays, <i>Bibliothèque
      Gauloise</i>, Paris, 1858, 18mo.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this edition M. Lacroix, following M. de Lincy&rsquo;s example, went to the
      MSS. for his text, which he annotated with care and erudition. All his
      notes of any importance are reproduced in the present translation. The
      edition of 1858 was reprinted in 1875.
    </p>
    <p>
      XXV. <i>L&rsquo;Heptaméron, &amp;c</i>. Gamier frères, Paris, n.d., 1 vol. 18mo.
      This was long the &ldquo;popular&rdquo; edition in France. The text, which is
      considerably modernised, is of no value.
    </p>
    <p>
      XXVI. <i>Les sept Journées de la Reine de Navarre, suivies de la huitième</i>.
      Paris, Librairie des Bibliophiles (Jouaust), 1872, 4 vols. l6mo.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this edition Gruget&rsquo;s text is followed; the notes, &amp;c, are by M.
      Lacroix. The work is prized for its illustrations (a portrait and eight
      etchings) by Leopold Flameng. It was originally issued in eight parts. The
      value of the copies varies according to the paper on which they are
      printed. Those on India or Whatman paper, with a duplicate set of the
      engravings, command high prices. The text has been reissued by the same
      firm in two cr. 8vo vols, under the title of <i>L&rsquo;Heptaméron des contes,
      etc</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      XXVII. <i>L&rsquo;Heptaméron des Nouvelles, &amp;c</i>, preface, notes, &amp;c,
      by Benjamin Pifteau, in the <i>Nouvelle Collection Jannet</i>, Alphonse
      Lemerre, Paris, 1875, 2 vols. l6mo.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, undoubtedly the best of all the cheap editions, has been reprinted
      by Marpon &amp; Flammarion, Paris, n.d. The text is from the MSS.; the
      notes are mainly abbreviated from those of MM. de Lincy and Lacroix. M.
      Pifteau supplies an introduction and glossary.
    </p>
    <p>
      XXVIII. <i>L&rsquo;Heptaméron, &amp;c., publié avec Introduction, Notes et
      Glossaire par Félix Frank</i>. Liseux, Paris, 1879, 3 vols. 12mo.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, from the literary point of view, is one of the most important of
      modern editions. The text is not taken from the same MS. as was followed
      by M. de Lincy. The tales are preceded by a lengthy introduction, in which
      the editor discusses Queen Margaret&rsquo;s work and seeks to identify the
      supposed narrators of her tales. He has frequently been quoted in the
      notes to this translation.
    </p>
    <p>
      XXIX. <i>L&rsquo;Heptaméron, &amp;c, avec notes, variantes et glossaire par F.
      Dillaye et notice par A. France</i>. A. Lemerre, Paris, 1879.
    </p>
    <p>
      A handy edition based on the MSS. The notes embody the substance of M. de
      Lincy&rsquo;s and M. Lacroix&rsquo;s researches with additional particulars supplied
      by M. Dillaye, who has been quoted in the course of the present work.
    </p>
    <p>
      XXX. <i>L&rsquo;Heptaméron, &amp;c., publié stir les manuscrits avec les notes
      de MM. Le Poux de Lincy et Anatole de Montaiglon</i>. Auguste Eudes,
      Paris, 1880, 8 vols. 1. 8vo and 4 vols. cr. 8vo.
    </p>
    <p>
      The edition in 8 vols, (two copies of which on parchment were issued at
      £44 each; and twelve on Japanese paper at £20 each) is illustrated with
      the Freudenberg plates; that in 4 vols, contains the text only. The text
      is the same as that of No. XXIII.; but with additional notes, prefatory
      matter, &amp;c. The copyright attaching to this edition was acquired for
      the present work, in which all M. de Montaiglon&rsquo;s important notes are
      reproduced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the English translations of the <i>Heptameron</i> are the following:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Heptameron</i>, or the <i>History of the Fortunate Lovers</i>,
      translated by R. Codrington, London, 1654, 12mo. (Dedicated to Thomas
      Stanley, the translator of Anacreon and editor of Æschylus, and based on
      Boaistuau&rsquo;s defective text.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Heptameron of Margaret, Queen of Navarre, nota first translated
      from the original text, by Walter K. Kelly</i>. Bohn (extra volume),
      London, 1855. This has been several times reprinted. The translation is a
      very free rendering of M. de Lincy&rsquo;s text; many passages are deficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Heptameron, &amp;c., translated from the original French by Arthur
      Machen</i>. Privately printed (G. Redway), London, 1886, 1 vol. 1. 8vo. A
      scholarly translation, not annotated; illustrated with the etchings by
      Flameng (see <i>ante</i>, edition xxv.).
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>The Fortunate Lovers, twenty-seven novels of the Queen of Navarre,
      translated by Arthur Machen, edited with notes and introduction by A. Mary
      F. Robinson</i>. G. Redway, London, 1887, 8vo. Etched frontispiece by G.
      P. Jacomb Hood. This only contains such of the tales as the lady-editor
      considered unobjectionable. In her introduction she sketches the life of
      Queen Margaret and discusses the identity of the supposed narrators of the
      tales. Some of the notes are original, but the majority are based upon the
      researches of French commentators.&mdash;Ed.
